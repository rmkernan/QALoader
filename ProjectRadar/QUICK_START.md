## 🧠 NEW: Adaptive Intelligence (30 seconds)

### Let Radar Recommend Your Approach
```markdown
# Analyze task complexity first
User: "radar: analyze implementing payment processing"

Radar: "High complexity detected (Score: 75/100)
       Recommend: Multi-agent coordination
       Reason: Frontend + Backend + Security requirements"

# Or for simpler tasks
User: "radar: analyze fixing typo in header"

Radar: "Low complexity (Score: 20/100)
       Recommend: Single-agent execution
       Reason: Single file, no dependencies"

# Testing commands (for validation)
User: "radar: start testing mode"
User: "radar: run test [test-id]"
User: "radar: generate test report"
```

## 🎯 Common Scenarios (90 seconds)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Be Specific
```markdown
❌ "radar: load context"
✅ "radar: load context for adding email notifications"
```

### Tip 2: Use Component Names
```markdown
✅ "radar: load authentication context"
✅ "radar: load frontend context"
✅ "radar: load database context"
```

### Tip 3: Combine with Tasks
```markdown
✅ "radar: load context for debugging auth issues"

## 🚨 Quick Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Not finding files** | Be more specific about the task |
| **Too many files** | Use component-specific loading |
| **Missing patterns** | Check ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md |
| **Slow loading** | Use progressive loading strategy |
