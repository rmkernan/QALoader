# Project Radar System

**Purpose:** Streamlined project orientation system for new Claude instances working on QALoader  
**Created:** June 13, 2025. 10:03 a.m. Eastern Time  
**Updated:** June 14, 2025. 11:53 a.m. Eastern Time - Simplified and focused on practical project orientation

## üéØ What Project Radar Does

Project Radar provides quick, practical orientation for new Claude instances to understand the QALoader project structure and become productive immediately.

### **Simple-First Approach**
- **Try simple tools first** - Glob, Grep, Read solve most straightforward tasks
- **Use PROJECT_INDEX.md** for quick project overview and file lookup
- **Reference ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md** when you need detailed technical context
- **No complex algorithms** - just practical guidance and references

## üìÅ Core Files (Simplified)

### **Essential Files**
1. **QUICK_START.md** - 2-minute introduction to Project Radar
2. **PROJECT_INDEX.md** - Lightweight orientation guide with file lookup by task type
3. **ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md** - Comprehensive technical reference for detailed context

### **Integration Points**
- Works with `../CLAUDE.md` development guidelines
- References comprehensive documentation in `Docs/`
- Provides section-based navigation to avoid information overload

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **For New Claude Instances:**
1. **Read QUICK_START.md** (2 minutes) - Understanding what Project Radar is
2. **Read PROJECT_INDEX.md** (2-3 minutes) - Project overview and task-based file lookup
3. **Reference ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md sections** as needed for detailed technical context

### **Simple Workflow:**
```
Task Request ‚Üí Try Simple Tools ‚Üí PROJECT_INDEX.md lookup ‚Üí ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md section (if needed)
```

### **Example:**
```
User: "How do I add authentication?"
‚Üí PROJECT_INDEX.md ‚Üí "Authentication/Security Tasks" section
‚Üí ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md ‚Üí "Authentication/Security Tasks" detailed reference  
‚Üí You know: auth_service.py, routers/auth.py, LoginView.tsx are key files
```

## üìä Benefits

- **Quick Orientation**: New Claude instances productive in 5 minutes
- **No Over-Engineering**: Simple file lookup instead of complex algorithms  
- **Maintainable**: Section-based references that stay current
- **Practical Focus**: Answers "where do I look for X?" effectively
- **Token Efficient**: Load only relevant context when needed

## üìö Documentation References

### **QALoader Project Context**
- **PROJECT_INDEX.md** - Quick orientation and file lookup
- **ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md** - Detailed technical reference
- **../CLAUDE.md** - Development guidelines and coding standards

### **Specific Development Areas**
- **Backend:** `backend/BACKEND_CONTEXT.md`
- **APIs:** `Docs/APIs_COMPLETE.md`
- **Deployment:** `Docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`

## üóÇÔ∏è Archived Files

Complex algorithmic approaches have been moved to `archived/` folder:
- CONTEXT_DISCOVERY.md (scoring algorithms)
- ADAPTIVE_INTELLIGENCE.md (complexity analysis)
- CONTEXTUAL_INTEGRATION.md (integration patterns)
- CONTEXT_LOADER.md (radar commands)
- MultiAgent/ (orchestration protocols)

These were over-engineered solutions that created more complexity than value.
