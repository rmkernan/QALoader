# Duplicate Detection Testing - Handoff Context

**Created:** June 19, 2025. 6:01 PM Eastern Time  
**Purpose:** Complete context for new Claude instance to create and execute duplicate detection tests

## What Was Just Implemented

A PostgreSQL-based duplicate detection system using the pg_trgm extension for text similarity matching. The system:

### Core Features
- **Non-blocking uploads**: Files upload successfully, duplicates detected in background
- **PostgreSQL pg_trgm**: Native database text similarity matching (not custom algorithms)
- **Configurable thresholds**: 60%-90% similarity detection 
- **Post-upload notifications**: Toast messages with duplicate counts and management links
- **Management interface**: Dedicated `/duplicates` view for reviewing and deleting duplicates
- **Batch operations**: Select and delete multiple duplicates at once

### Implementation Details
- **Backend**: FastAPI with new `/api/duplicates` endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL pg_trgm extension with GIN index on question text
- **Frontend**: React component with similarity threshold controls
- **Integration**: Added to main app navigation and upload workflow

## Testing Objective

Create automated tests to validate the duplicate detection accuracy across different similarity levels using real investment banking questions as test data.

## Available Resources

### Test Data Source
File: `Docs/Supabase/BIW_400-ib-interview-questions_p6-18_markdown_gemini-2_5-flash-preview-04-17.md`
- Contains 32+ accounting/finance questions in proper markdown format
- Questions about financial statements, depreciation, working capital, etc.
- Perfect source for creating similarity variations

### System Architecture
- **Upload endpoint**: `POST /api/upload-markdown` (returns duplicate info)
- **Detection endpoint**: `GET /api/duplicates?threshold=0.8`
- **Scan endpoint**: `GET /api/duplicates/scan?question_ids=id1,id2`
- **Delete endpoint**: `DELETE /api/duplicates/batch`

### Expected Question Format
```markdown
# Topic: Accounting
## Subtopic: Financial Statements
### Difficulty: Basic
#### Type: Question
    **Question:** Walk me through the 3 financial statements.
    **Answer:** The 3 major financial statements are...
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories Needed
1. **High Similarity (90%+)**: Near-identical questions with minor word changes
2. **Medium Similarity (80-89%)**: Same concept, different phrasing  
3. **Low Similarity (60-79%)**: Related topics, different questions
4. **Clean Unique**: Completely different questions (no duplicates expected)
5. **Cross-topic**: Similar questions across different topics
6. **Edge Cases**: Special formatting, punctuation, capitalization

### Testing Approach
- **Simple bash scripts** using curl (no complex test frameworks)
- **Upload test files** → **Call detection APIs** → **Validate results**
- **Compare detected pairs** against known/expected duplicate relationships
- **Generate pass/fail reports** for each similarity threshold

### Validation Criteria
- 90%+ precision (detected duplicates are actual duplicates)
- 90%+ recall (actual duplicates are detected)
- Threshold accuracy (80% threshold finds 80%+ similar questions)
- No false positives on clean unique questions

## Current System State

### Database Status
- pg_trgm migration file created: `backend/database_migrations/enable_pg_trgm.sql`
- **MUST BE RUN** in Supabase before testing
- Creates extension and GIN index on question text

### Code Status  
- All TypeScript/ESLint checks pass
- Production build verified
- Ready for testing

### Prerequisites for Testing
1. Run pg_trgm SQL migration in Supabase SQL editor
2. Start backend: `cd backend && npm run start:backend`  
3. Get JWT token for API authentication
4. Create test markdown files with known similarity relationships

## Implementation Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `backend/app/services/duplicate_service.py` - Core duplicate detection logic
- `backend/app/routers/duplicates.py` - API endpoints  
- `src/components/DuplicateManagementView.tsx` - Management interface
- `backend/database_migrations/enable_pg_trgm.sql` - Database setup

### Modified Files
- `backend/app/routers/upload.py` - Added post-upload duplicate detection
- `backend/app/models/question.py` - Enhanced BatchUploadResult with duplicate fields
- `src/types.ts` - Added DuplicateGroup interface
- `src/services/api.ts` - Added duplicate management functions
- `src/contexts/AppContext.tsx` - Enhanced upload notifications
- Navigation components to include duplicate scanner

## Success Metrics

### Functional Testing
- Upload process completes without errors
- Duplicate detection returns results within 5 seconds
- Management interface displays duplicates correctly
- Batch deletion removes selected questions

### Accuracy Testing  
- Known high-similarity pairs (95%+) detected at 80%+ thresholds
- Known medium-similarity pairs (85%) detected at 80% threshold
- Known low-similarity pairs (70%) only detected at 60-70% thresholds
- Unique questions never flagged as duplicates
- Cross-topic duplicates detected when similarity is high enough

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Create test data files** with documented expected duplicate pairs
2. **Write upload/detection scripts** using curl and JSON parsing
3. **Execute test suite** at multiple similarity thresholds
4. **Validate results** against expected outcomes
5. **Generate test report** with pass/fail for each test case
6. **Document any accuracy issues** or threshold adjustments needed

The testing should be simple, automated, and provide clear validation of the duplicate detection accuracy across realistic investment banking question scenarios.
