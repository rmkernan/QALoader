# Orchestrator Session Handoff

**Session Period:** June 12, 2025. 10:39 a.m. to 11:02 a.m. Eastern Time
**Context Status:** Ready for clearing - Protocols updated and tested
**Next Orchestrator:** Start with Opus for strategic coordination

## Critical Fixes Applied This Session

### **Protocol Violations Corrected**
- **Model Confirmation Protocol**: Updated to require WAITING for user response before major decisions
- **Communication Constraints**: Documented that agents have NO direct communication except through coordination files
- **Task Tool Misuse**: Clarified Task tool is inappropriate for coordinated multi-agent work

### **Files Updated**
- `CLAUDE.md`: Enhanced model selection strategy with explicit waiting requirements
- `HandoffProtocol.md`: Added model confirmation protocol and communication constraints
- `AgentInstructions.md`: Clear warning about inter-agent communication limitations

## Agent Status Unchanged
- **Agent1**: Still assigned task-specific documentation path mapping (from previous session)
- **Agent2**: Still assigned task execution quality assessment (from previous session)
- **Both agents ready** for orchestrator coordination via their Agent[N].md files

## Critical Context for Next Orchestrator

### **Communication Architecture**
- Agents communicate ONLY through writing to their Agent[N].md files
- User must mediate any information sharing between agents
- No real-time collaboration - orchestrator synthesizes findings separately

### **Coordination Strategy**
- Check Agent1.md and Agent2.md for current status
- Coordinate existing assignments rather than re-assigning
- Use proper model confirmation protocol before major decisions

## Recommended Startup Protocol

### **Model Selection**
**Start with Opus** - This is strategic coordination requiring:
- Agent findings synthesis
- Documentation architecture design
- Implementation planning
- Quality assessment of recommendations

### **Initial Actions**
1. Execute model confirmation protocol (ask and WAIT for response)
2. Search memory for project context
3. Read this handoff document
4. Check Agent1.md and Agent2.md for current status
5. Coordinate based on existing assignments

## Success Metrics Established
1. **Task Navigation**: LLM can trace from task type to implementation docs in <3 hops
2. **Execution Success**: 90%+ task completion rate using documentation alone
3. **Information Sufficiency**: All critical task types have complete documentation paths
4. **Zero Dead Ends**: Every documentation path leads to actionable implementation guidance

## Memory Updated
- All protocol fixes and communication constraints documented
- Critical coordination discoveries recorded
- Project context preserved for next session

**Ready for context clearing and fresh Opus orchestrator startup.**
