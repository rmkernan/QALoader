# Orchestrator Session Handoff

**Session Period:** June 12, 2025. 2:30 p.m. to 10:39 a.m. Eastern Time
**Context Status:** Full - Ready for clearing and Opus startup
**Next Orchestrator:** Opus instance for strategic coordination

## Critical Context Preservation

### **Project Mission Established**
- **Goal**: Create task-oriented documentation system where LLMs can navigate from task assignment to implementation completion
- **Core Concept**: Different tasks need different documentation trails (API bug fix vs UI styling vs deployment)
- **Strategic Focus**: Documentation + well-commented code files for complete task support

### **Agent Coordination System Operational**
- **Communication Protocol**: Sender→receiver triggers ("A1 ready for O", "O ready for A2")
- **Token Efficiency**: Agents read only recent 10 lines from coordination files
- **Identity Verification**: Prevents terminal mix-ups with wrong triggers
- **Memory Integration**: Systematic search and update protocols established

### **Key Strategic Decisions Made**
- **Opus Usage Strategy**: Use Opus for strategic synthesis, Sonnet for execution tasks
- **Context Management**: Compacting preferred over clearing for continuity
- **Documentation Scope**: Both .md files AND in-code comments/annotations critical
- **Task-Oriented Focus**: Real-world task completion scenarios instead of general onboarding

## Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] **Launch Agent1**: Task-specific documentation path mapping and code quality assessment
- [ ] **Launch Agent2**: Task execution simulation with real code file analysis  
- [ ] **Coordinate parallel work**: Both agents working simultaneously for efficiency
- [ ] **Synthesize findings**: Create strategic recommendations for documentation architecture
- [ ] **Design implementation plan**: Practical roadmap for documentation reorganization

## Strategic Context for Opus Orchestrator

### **Why This Project Needs Opus Strategic Reasoning**
- **Complex synthesis required**: Integrating findings from documentation paths + code quality + task execution scenarios
- **Architecture design challenge**: Creating optimal information hierarchy for different task types
- **Nuanced decision-making**: Balancing usability vs. maintenance vs. discoverability
- **Long-term impact**: Documentation decisions affect project efficiency for months/years

### **Optimal Opus Usage Strategy**
- **Strategic coordination**: Agent management, task refinement, findings synthesis
- **Architecture design**: Documentation structure and information flow optimization  
- **Implementation planning**: Practical roadmap creation with priority sequencing
- **Quality assurance**: Ensuring recommendations actually improve LLM task completion

### **Model Switching Strategy for Orchestrator**

#### **Use Opus For (High-Value Strategic Work):**
- **Agent findings synthesis** - Integrating complex discoveries from multiple agents
- **Documentation architecture design** - Creating optimal information hierarchy
- **Strategic decision-making** - Resolving conflicting findings and priorities
- **Implementation roadmap creation** - Complex planning with dependencies
- **Quality assessment of recommendations** - Evaluating proposed solutions

#### **Switch to Sonnet For (Execution Tasks):**
- **Routine agent status checks** - "Are agents ready?", "What's their progress?"
- **File organization and cleanup** - Moving files, organizing deliverables
- **Git coordination and backup operations** - Commits, branch management
- **Detailed implementation execution** - Following established plans
- **Status reporting to user** - Communicating progress and updates

#### **Model Awareness Protocol**
**IMPORTANT: Orchestrator should periodically confirm current model:**
- **Ask user**: "Am I currently running on Opus or Sonnet?"
- **Check before major decisions**: Confirm Opus for strategic work
- **Recommend switches proactively**: 
  - "This strategic synthesis requires Opus reasoning - should I switch?"
  - "This routine task is better suited for Sonnet - recommend switching to save Opus budget"

## Critical Success Metrics

1. **Task Navigation**: LLM can trace from any task type to implementation docs in <3 hops
2. **Execution Success**: 90%+ task completion rate using documentation alone
3. **Information Sufficiency**: All critical task types have complete documentation paths
4. **Zero Dead Ends**: Every documentation path leads to actionable implementation guidance
5. **Efficient Routing**: No unnecessary documentation consumption for specific tasks

## Ready for Handoff

✅ Memory updated with complete project context
✅ Handoff document created with critical information  
✅ Agent assignments prepared and waiting
✅ Coordination system operational and tested
✅ Strategic context established for Opus decision-making

**Recommendation: Clear context and start fresh Opus session for optimal strategic coordination.**
