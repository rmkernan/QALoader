## 🎯 Project Purpose

### What This Project Does
QALoader is a comprehensive web application for managing financial education Q&A content. It enables content administrators to:
- Upload and parse financial question banks from Markdown files
- Curate and organize questions by topic, difficulty, and type
- Analyze content distribution and learning effectiveness
- Provide secure access to educational content for learning platforms

### Business Context
- **Target Users:** Financial education content administrators and instructors
- **Domain:** Financial education (DCF, Valuation, M&A, LBO, etc.)
- **Use Case:** Internal tool for managing question banks that feed learning applications
- **Scale:** Hundreds to thousands of questions across multiple financial topics

### Key Value Propositions
1. **Streamlined Content Management:** Replace manual Q&A curation with automated parsing and validation
2. **Quality Assurance:** Built-in validation and preview capabilities prevent content errors
3. **Analytics-Driven Insights:** Dashboard analytics help optimize content balance and coverage
4. **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle growth in content volume and user base

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Technology Stack
**Frontend (React/TypeScript):**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- TailwindCSS for responsive, utility-first styling
- Context API for global state management
- Vite for development and build tooling

**Backend (Python/FastAPI):**
- FastAPI for high-performance async API development
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) for database and authentication
- Pydantic for data validation and serialization
- JWT-based authentication with development bypass modes

**External Integrations:**
- Google Gemini API for Markdown parsing and content analysis
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- File upload with drag-and-drop support

### Architecture Patterns
- **Frontend:** Component-based architecture with context providers
- **Backend:** Service layer pattern with dependency injection
- **Database:** Relational design with activity logging
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with development flexibility
- **API Design:** RESTful endpoints with comprehensive OpenAPI documentation

**Key Features:**
- Topic selection with new topic creation
- Drag-and-drop file upload interface
- Gemini API-powered Markdown parsing
- Dry run validation with preview capabilities
- Bulk replacement with rollback safety

**User Workflow:**
1. Select target topic or create new topic
2. Upload Markdown file with questions
3. Trigger dry run analysis for validation
4. Review parsed questions and fix any issues
5. Confirm and execute bulk load operation

### 3. Content Curation (Question Management)
**Purpose:** Provide detailed question-level management capabilities

**Key Features:**
- Advanced search and filtering (topic, difficulty, type, text)
- Individual question editing with validation
- New question creation with auto-generated IDs
- Question duplication for template reuse
- Bulk operations (delete, move, export)
- Markdown export for backup and portability

**User Workflow:**
1. Apply filters to find target questions
2. Edit existing questions or create new ones
3. Use bulk actions for large-scale changes
4. Export filtered results for backup or sharing

### 4. Authentication & Security
**Purpose:** Secure access control with development flexibility

**Key Features:**
- JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
- Development bypass modes for testing
- Session management with automatic logout
- Role-based access control ready for expansion

## 🔧 Development Workflows

### Getting Started for New LLMs
1. **Read Core Documentation:**
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Development guidelines and standards
   - `Docs/DocumentationStandards.md` - Required documentation patterns
   - `backend/CLAUDE.md` or `src/CLAUDE.md` - Technology-specific guidelines

2. **Understand Project Structure:**
   - Review this PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md for context
   - Check `Docs/APIs.md` for backend API contracts
   - Examine component architecture in `src/components/`

3. **Set Up Development Environment:**
   - Backend: `cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
   - Frontend: Use static file server or Vite development server
   - Database: Supabase connection via environment variables

### Common Development Tasks

#### API Development Tasks
**Documentation Path:** `backend/CLAUDE.md` → API route files → Service layer → Database models
- Route handlers in `backend/app/routers/`
- Business logic in `backend/app/services/`
- Data models in `backend/app/models/`
- Database operations through Supabase client

#### Frontend Component Tasks
**Documentation Path:** `src/CLAUDE.md` → Component files → Styling guidelines → Context integration
- React components in `src/components/`
- Global state in `src/contexts/AppContext.tsx`
- Styling with TailwindCSS utility classes
- API integration through `src/services/`

#### Database Tasks
**Documentation Path:** `backend/CLAUDE.md` → Service files → Database documentation
