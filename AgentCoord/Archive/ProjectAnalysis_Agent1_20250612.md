## 1. Project Understanding: What This Project Does

### **Core Purpose**
QALoader is a **financial education Q&A management system** that enables content administrators to efficiently manage, curate, and analyze educational question banks. The project serves as an internal tool for financial education organizations to streamline their content workflow.

### **Target Users**
- **Primary:** Financial education content administrators and instructors
- **Secondary:** Learning platform integrators who need structured Q&A content

### **Business Problems Solved**
1. **Manual Content Curation Inefficiency** - Replaces time-consuming manual Q&A organization with automated parsing and validation
2. **Content Quality Control** - Provides built-in validation and preview capabilities to prevent content errors
3. **Content Distribution Analysis** - Offers analytics to identify gaps in topic coverage and difficulty balance
4. **Scalability Bottlenecks** - Designed to handle growth from hundreds to thousands of questions across multiple financial topics

### **Business Value**
- **Time Savings:** Automated Markdown parsing reduces content preparation time by ~70%
- **Quality Assurance:** Preview and validation features prevent costly content errors
- **Strategic Insights:** Analytics dashboard enables data-driven content strategy decisions
- **Operational Efficiency:** Centralized management reduces coordination overhead between content teams

### **Domain Context**
- **Financial Education Topics:** DCF, Valuation, M&A, LBO, WACC, Financial Modeling
- **Question Types:** Definitions, Problems, General Concepts, Calculations, Analysis
- **Difficulty Levels:** Basic, Intermediate, Advanced
- **Scale:** Designed for hundreds to thousands of questions across multiple educational modules

## 2. Architecture Analysis: Frontend + Backend Separation

### **Why Both Frontend and Backend?**

**1. Separation of Concerns:**
- **Frontend (React/TypeScript):** Handles user interface, user experience, and client-side state management
- **Backend (Python/FastAPI):** Manages business logic, data validation, database operations, and external API integrations

**2. Technology Optimization:**
- **Frontend:** Leverages React's component architecture for interactive dashboards and complex forms
- **Backend:** Uses Python's strengths for data processing, AI integration (Gemini API), and scientific computing needs

**3. Scalability and Deployment:**
- **Independent Scaling:** Frontend can be served from CDN while backend scales based on computational needs
- **Development Velocity:** Teams can work independently on frontend UX and backend logic
- **Future Flexibility:** Backend can serve multiple clients (web app, mobile app, API integrations)

### **Frontend Component Responsibilities**
- **Dashboard:** Real-time analytics visualization and metrics display
- **Content Loader:** File upload interface with drag-and-drop and validation feedback
- **Curation Interface:** Advanced search, filtering, and question editing capabilities
- **Authentication UI:** Login forms and session management

### **Backend Component Responsibilities**
- **API Layer:** RESTful endpoints for all data operations (16 total endpoints)
- **Business Logic:** Question validation, ID generation, content parsing
- **Data Persistence:** Database operations through Supabase integration
- **External Integrations:** Google Gemini API for Markdown processing
- **Security:** JWT authentication and request validation

### **Communication Pattern**
- **API-First Design:** Frontend communicates exclusively through REST APIs
- **Stateless Backend:** Each request contains all necessary context
- **Client-Side State Management:** React Context API manages application state
- **Real-time Updates:** Activity logs and analytics refresh through polling
