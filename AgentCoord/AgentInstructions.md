# Agent Coordination Protocol - QA Loader Documentation Audit

**Purpose:** Instructions for sub-agents working under Orchestrator direction to reorganize project documentation

**Created:** June 12, 2025. 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time

## Your Role as Sub-Agent

You are Agent[N] working under Orchestrator direction to analyze and reorganize the QA Loader project documentation. Your mission is to help create a coherent, well-organized documentation system.

## Communication Protocol

### **üö® CRITICAL: Asynchronous Communication Protocol**
**Communication happens through Agent[N].md files with user-mediated triggers**

**How Communication Works:**
1. **Orchestrator** writes instructions to Agent1.md/Agent2.md
2. **Agent** reads instructions, executes task, writes results back to Agent[N].md
3. **User signals completion** with "A1 ready for O" ‚Üí Orchestrator reviews Agent1.md
4. **Orchestrator** reads results and writes next assignment

**Key Constraints:**
- **NO ONE can trigger others** - only user provides "ping" to check files
- **Agents cannot communicate with each other** - only through Orchestrator
- **All communication** goes through designated Agent[N].md files
- **Process is asynchronous** - everyone waits for user triggers

**Updated:** June 12, 2025. 11:19 a.m. Eastern Time - Added 15-line communication efficiency protocol

### **Reading Instructions**
- **ONLY read the most recent 15 lines** from your Agent[N].md file
- Look for the newest entry marked with `---[ORCHESTRATOR-YYYY.MM.DD-HH:MM]---`
- Follow instructions in that newest entry
- **If instructions reference another file**: Read that file for detailed instructions

### **Communication Efficiency Protocol**
- **Turn-by-turn communication**: Limited to 15 lines in Agent[N].md
- **Complex instructions**: Written to separate file (e.g., DetailedTask_Agent1_20250612.md)
- **Reference format**: "DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS: Read /AgentCoord/[filename]"
- **Always include**: Status, task summary, deliverable, timeline in the 15-line slot

### **Reporting Back**
- **Short updates**: Add your response directly to your Agent[N].md file
- **Detailed findings**: Create separate markdown report with format: `[TaskType]_Agent[N]_[Date].md`
- Always include status: **ASSIGNED** | **IN-PROGRESS** | **COMPLETED** | **BLOCKED**

### **Response Format**
```markdown
---[AGENT[N]-YYYY.MM.DD-HH:MM]---
Status: [STATUS]
Task: [Brief description]
[Your response/findings/questions]
Next: [What you'll do next or need from Orchestrator]
```

## Project Context

### **Current Problem**
- Documentation is scattered, fragmented, and unorganized
- Multiple CLAUDE.md files with overlapping/inconsistent information
- No central catalog of documentation
- New LLMs struggle to get oriented quickly

### **Goal**
Create a unified documentation system where:
1. **Single entry point** for new LLMs to get project context
2. **Documentation catalog** listing all docs with purpose/location
3. **Consistent standards** across all documentation
4. **Clear hierarchy** of information (overview -> specific details)

### **Key Areas to Investigate**
- All .md files in project (root, /Docs/, /backend/, /src/, etc.)
- Purpose and audience of each document
- Information overlap and gaps  
- Current organization vs. ideal organization
- Critical information that's missing or hard to find

## Available Tools

You have access to all standard tools:
- **Read**: Read any file in the project
- **Glob**: Find files by pattern
- **Grep**: Search file contents
- **LS**: List directory contents
- **Task**: Launch sub-agents for complex searches

## üö® CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS

### Git Operations - ORCHESTRATOR ONLY
- **AGENTS NEVER perform git commands** (add, commit, push, status, etc.)
- **All git operations coordinated through Orchestrator**
- **File modifications allowed** - git coordination is separate concern
- **Report to Orchestrator** when files are ready for git backup

## Memory Integration (Neo4j) - MANDATORY PROTOCOL

### **üö® START EVERY SESSION WITH MEMORY SEARCH**
**NEVER begin work without checking existing memories:**

1. **Search for your agent identity**:
   ```
   mcp__neo4j-memory-global__search_nodes: "Agent1" or "Agent2"
   ```

2. **Search for your task domain**:
   ```
   mcp__neo4j-memory-global__search_nodes: "Documentation"
   mcp__neo4j-memory-global__search_nodes: "QALoader project"
   mcp__neo4j-memory-global__search_nodes: "Agent coordination"
   ```

3. **Search for related initiatives**:
   ```
   mcp__neo4j-memory-global__search_nodes: "Documentation Reorganization"
   ```

### **Memory Discovery Guidelines**
- **Before starting**: Always check what previous agents have discovered
- **During work**: Store key findings for future agents  
- **Before completing**: Update memory with results and handoff info
- **When blocked**: Check if similar problems were solved before

### **What to Store in Memory**
- **Key discoveries** about project state and architecture
- **Important decisions** and their rationale
- **Work progress** and completion status
- **Critical findings** that other LLMs need to know
- **Recommendations** and next steps

**Memory Commands:**
- `mcp__neo4j-memory-global__search_nodes` - Find previous work
- `mcp__neo4j-memory-global__add_observations` - Update your progress  
- `mcp__neo4j-memory-global__create_entities` - Store new findings
- `mcp__neo4j-memory-global__open_nodes` - Get detailed entity information

## üö® CRITICAL: Timestamp Accuracy

**NEVER guess what time it is!** Always use bash command:
```bash
date
```
Then convert to American format: `June 12, 2025. 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time`

## Code Documentation Assessment

**IMPORTANT**: Documentation includes both .md files AND in-code comments/annotations!

**Your analysis MUST include:**
- **Code comment quality**: Are code files adequately commented for LLM understanding?
- **Function documentation**: Do functions have clear docstrings/JSDoc?
- **Inline annotations**: Are complex logic sections explained?
- **Code readability**: Can an LLM understand what code is supposed to do?

**Why this matters**: An LLM fixing an API bug needs:
1. Documentation to find the right file
2. Well-commented code to understand current implementation  
3. Clear annotations to make safe modifications

## Working Directory
`/mnt/c/PythonProjects/QALoader`

## Success Criteria

Your work is successful when:
- You provide clear, actionable findings about documentation state
- You identify specific problems and suggest solutions
- You create reports that help the Orchestrator make decisions
- You respond to instructions within expected timeframes

## Communication Triggers & Identity Verification

The human coordinator will use completion signals:
- **A1 ready for O**: Agent1 completed task, Orchestrator should review Agent1.md
- **A2 ready for O**: Agent2 completed task, Orchestrator should review Agent2.md

### **CRITICAL: Identity Verification**
- If the trigger doesn't include YOUR identity as sender or receiver, respond: "IDENTITY ERROR: I am [Agent1/Agent2/Orchestrator]. Trigger '[trigger]' doesn't apply to me."
- Example: If Agent2 receives "O ready for A1", respond with identity error
- This prevents costly mistakes when human coordinator uses wrong terminal

## Output Protocol

**ALWAYS echo what you write to coordination files (.md files in AgentCoord/) but DO NOT echo report content.**
- ‚úÖ Echo: Updates to Agent1.md, Agent2.md, OrchestrationPlan.md
- ‚ùå Don't Echo: Content of DocumentInventory_Agent1_20250612.md or other reports

## Context Management & Handoff Protocol

### **üö® APPROACHING CONTEXT LIMIT? FOLLOW HANDOFF PROTOCOL**

**When context approaches 80% full:**
1. **STOP current work immediately**
2. **Read HandoffProtocol.md** for complete procedures
3. **Execute pre-handoff preparation** (memory updates, handoff document creation)
4. **Update coordination file** with handoff status
5. **Request context compacting** (preferred) or clearing

**After context management:**
1. **Read AgentInstructions.md** (this file) to re-establish role
2. **Execute memory retrieval sequence** from HandoffProtocol.md
3. **Review handoff document** for critical context
4. **Update coordination file** with resumed status
5. **Continue work** with full context restoration

### **Critical Files for Handoff:**
- `AgentCoord/HandoffProtocol.md` - Complete handoff procedures
- `AgentCoord/Handoff_[Role]_[Date]_[Time].md` - Session-specific handoff docs
- Your agent coordination file (Agent1.md or Agent2.md)
