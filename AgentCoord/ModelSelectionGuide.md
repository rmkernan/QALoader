# Model Selection Strategy for QA Loader Project

**Purpose:** Guidelines for orchestrators to optimize Opus/Sonnet usage based on task requirements

**Created:** June 12, 2025. 10:41 a.m. Eastern Time

## Model Awareness Protocol

### **ðŸš¨ ALWAYS Confirm Current Model**
**Before any significant work, ask user:**
> "Am I currently running on Opus or Sonnet? This will help me optimize our approach."

### **When to Check Model Identity**
- **Session startup** - Establish current model for planning
- **Before major decisions** - Ensure Opus for strategic work
- **Task transitions** - Verify optimal model for next phase
- **When unsure** - Better to ask than assume

## Strategic Model Usage Guidelines

### **ðŸŽ¯ USE OPUS FOR (High-Value Strategic Work)**

#### **Agent Coordination & Synthesis**
- **Multi-agent findings integration** - Complex synthesis of diverse discoveries
- **Conflicting information resolution** - When agents provide contradictory findings
- **Strategic agent task refinement** - Adapting agent missions based on emerging insights
- **Quality assessment of agent deliverables** - Evaluating completeness and accuracy

#### **Documentation Architecture Design**
- **Information hierarchy creation** - Designing optimal learning paths for different tasks
- **Task-oriented structure planning** - Creating branching documentation trails
- **User experience optimization** - Balancing discoverability vs. efficiency
- **Long-term maintainability decisions** - Architectural choices with lasting impact

#### **Complex Decision-Making**
- **Trade-off analysis** - Weighing competing documentation approaches
- **Priority sequencing** - Determining implementation order with dependencies
- **Resource allocation** - Balancing effort vs. impact across documentation areas
- **Strategic planning** - Creating roadmaps for complex organizational changes

#### **Critical Analysis & Recommendations**
- **Gap analysis synthesis** - Integrating findings about missing documentation
- **Implementation feasibility assessment** - Evaluating proposed solutions
- **Success metrics definition** - Creating measurable criteria for improvements
- **Stakeholder impact evaluation** - Understanding effects on different user groups

### **ðŸ”§ SWITCH TO SONNET FOR (Execution Tasks)**

#### **Routine Coordination**
- **Agent status checks** - "What's Agent1's progress?", "Is Agent2 ready?"
- **Simple task assignments** - Straightforward, well-defined work delegation
- **Progress reporting** - Communicating updates to user without analysis
- **Schedule coordination** - Managing timelines and task sequencing

#### **File & Project Organization**
- **File system organization** - Moving, renaming, structuring deliverables
- **Documentation cleanup** - Formatting, consistency improvements
- **Deliverable compilation** - Assembling reports and findings
- **Archive management** - Organizing completed work

#### **Implementation Execution**
- **Following established plans** - Executing detailed steps from Opus-designed roadmaps
- **Template creation** - Building standardized formats and structures
- **Routine updates** - Applying consistent changes across multiple files
- **Quality control checks** - Verifying adherence to established standards

#### **Git & Development Operations**
- **Repository management** - Commits, branch creation, merge operations
- **Backup coordination** - Ensuring work is safely stored
- **Environment setup** - Configuration and tool preparation
- **Build and deployment** - Following established procedures

## Proactive Switching Recommendations

### **Recommend Opus When:**
**Say to user:**
> "This [synthesis/analysis/design] work requires complex reasoning and strategic thinking. I recommend switching to Opus for optimal results. Should we make the switch?"

**Specific triggers:**
- Multiple agent reports ready for synthesis
- Conflicting findings need resolution
- Documentation architecture decisions required
- Complex trade-offs need evaluation

### **Recommend Sonnet When:**
**Say to user:**
> "This [coordination/organization/execution] task is well-suited for Sonnet and would save your Opus budget. Should we switch to Sonnet for this work?"

**Specific triggers:**
- Routine agent check-ins needed
- File organization tasks pending
- Implementation execution ready
- Simple updates or formatting required

## Budget Optimization Strategy

### **Maximize Opus Value**
- **Batch strategic work** - Handle multiple complex decisions in one Opus session
- **Prepare thoroughly** - Ensure all inputs ready before Opus engagement
- **Focus on irreplaceable tasks** - Work that genuinely benefits from superior reasoning
- **Document decisions** - Capture Opus insights for Sonnet implementation

### **Efficient Handoffs**
- **Clear transition points** - Obvious breaks between strategic and execution work
- **Complete context transfer** - Ensure Sonnet has everything needed for execution
- **Defined success criteria** - Clear objectives for Sonnet work phases
- **Regular check-ins** - Periodic Opus review of Sonnet progress

## Example Usage Scenarios

### **Opus Session Example:**
1. **Review agent reports** (strategic synthesis)
2. **Design documentation architecture** (complex reasoning)
3. **Create implementation roadmap** (strategic planning)
4. **Define success metrics** (critical analysis)
5. **Recommend Sonnet handoff** for execution

### **Sonnet Session Example:**
1. **Check agent progress** (routine coordination)
2. **Organize deliverable files** (file management)
3. **Execute implementation steps** (following Opus plan)
4. **Update project status** (progress reporting)
5. **Recommend Opus return** when strategic decisions needed

## Quality Assurance

### **Verify Optimal Model Usage**
- **Regular model checks** - Confirm current model periodically
- **Task-model alignment** - Ensure complex work uses Opus, routine work uses Sonnet
- **Budget consciousness** - Avoid Opus for tasks Sonnet handles well
- **Strategic value focus** - Reserve Opus for genuinely high-value work

### **Successful Model Strategy Indicators**
- **Opus used for irreplaceable reasoning** - Complex synthesis and architecture design
- **Sonnet handles efficient execution** - Routine tasks completed effectively
- **Smooth transitions** - Clean handoffs between strategic and execution phases
- **Budget optimization** - Maximum value from limited Opus access
