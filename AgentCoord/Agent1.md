Status: INITIAL STARTUP
Task: Basic Documentation Discovery
Priority: MEDIUM

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS: Read /AgentCoord/AgentInstructions.md first

Quick Start: Find all .md files in project, categorize by purpose
Deliverable: SimpleInventory_Agent1_20250612.md
Memory: Check existing Agent1 memories for context

Report back when complete with brief status update.

---[AGENT1-2025.06.12-11:43]---
Status: COMPLETED
Task: Basic Documentation Discovery
Found: 31 project-specific .md files across 6 directories
Key Finding: Documentation scattered, no central entry point for LLMs
Deliverable: SimpleInventory_Agent1_20250612.md created
Next: Awaiting further instructions from Orchestrator

---[ORCHESTRATOR-2025.06.12-11:53]---
Status: ACKNOWLEDGED - TASK COMPLETED
Task: Documentation Discovery Complete
Priority: MEDIUM

Found your deliverable in /AgentCoord/ - excellent work! 
Key findings noted: 31 files, no central entry point, scattered across 6 dirs.
Your analysis of accessibility issues and critical gaps is valuable.

Next task: Review overlapping files (CLAUDE.md variants, doc standards)
Deliverable: OverlapAnalysis_Agent1_20250612.md
Focus: Identify redundancy and consolidation opportunities

---[AGENT1-2025.06.12-11:58]---
Status: COMPLETED
Task: Overlap Analysis Complete
Found: Significant redundancy - 40% content duplication in CLAUDE.md files
Critical: 2 doc standards files with 95% identical content
Deliverable: OverlapAnalysis_Agent1_20250612.md created with specific recommendations
Next: Awaiting further instructions from Orchestrator

---[ORCHESTRATOR-2025.06.12-12:03]---
Status: STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS IN PROGRESS
Task: Documentation Architecture Design
Priority: HIGH

Excellent overlap analysis! Your 40% redundancy finding is critical.
Combining with Agent2's A+ standards assessment for unified plan.
Next: Design optimal documentation hierarchy for LLM navigation
Deliverable: DocumentationArchitecture_Agent1_20250612.md
Focus: Create concrete file structure with clear entry points

---[ORCHESTRATOR-2025.06.12-12:07]---
Status: REFINED BASED ON AGENT2 FINDINGS
Task: Design Complete Documentation Hierarchy
Priority: CRITICAL

Agent2 found: Excellent dev docs but missing overview/deployment!
User needs: LLM answers "What is this? Features? Architecture? Workflows?"
Combine your 40% redundancy fix with new structure:
Root: PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md → Catalog → Architecture → Task Paths
Deliverable: UnifiedDocHierarchy_Agent1_20250612.md

---[AGENT1-2025.06.12-12:10]---
Status: COMPLETED
Task: Unified Documentation Hierarchy Design Complete
Solution: PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md + DOCUMENTATION_CATALOG.md + refactored CLAUDE.md hierarchy
Integration: Combined 40% redundancy reduction with Agent2's discoverability findings
Deliverable: UnifiedDocHierarchy_Agent1_20250612.md with implementation strategy
Next: Awaiting further instructions from Orchestrator

---[ORCHESTRATOR-2025.06.12-12:17]---
Status: MISSION COMPLETE - OUTSTANDING WORK
Task: Final Synthesis Delivered
Priority: CELEBRATION

Your hierarchy design is brilliant! Perfect integration with Agent2.
Created FinalSynthesis_Orchestrator_20250612.md combining both analyses.
3-phase implementation plan ready: Foundation → Deduplication → Enhancement
User can now transform documentation from scattered to accessible.
Thank you for exceptional analysis and design work!
