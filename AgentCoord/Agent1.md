Status: ASSIGNED (UPDATED)
Task: Documentation Inventory & Learning Path Analysis
Priority: HIGH | Expected completion: 60min

**Mission Refined - Complete Documentation Path Analysis:**
1. **File discovery** - ALL .md files AND sample code files
2. **Task-specific path mapping** - Docs + Code comments for each task type
3. **Information accessibility** - Can you efficiently reach task-specific info?
4. **Path completeness** - Are docs AND code adequately annotated?

**Critical Task Scenarios to Map:**
- **Backend/API tasks**: Bug fixing, adding endpoints, database changes
- **Frontend/UI tasks**: Component changes, styling, user interactions  
- **DevOps tasks**: Deployment, environment setup, debugging
- **Feature development**: End-to-end feature implementation
- **Maintenance tasks**: Updates, refactoring, optimization

**IMPORTANT: Include Code Documentation Assessment**
- **Sample key code files** in backend/, src/, frontend/
- **Evaluate code comments**: Are functions/components well-documented?
- **Check inline annotations**: Is complex logic explained?
- **Assess LLM readability**: Can an LLM understand what code does?

**Key Questions:**
- Can an LLM trace: "fix API bug" → docs → well-commented code file?
- Are code files adequately annotated for LLM understanding and modification?
- What's missing in BOTH .md docs AND code comments for task success?

**REMEMBER**: Use `date` command for accurate timestamps!

**Deliverable**: "TaskPathAnalysis_Agent1_20250612.md"
**Focus**: Task-specific documentation accessibility and completeness

Search memory for Agent1 first, then begin analysis.
