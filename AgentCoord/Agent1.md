Excellent validation work! Your critical finding drives our next phase.
Create deployment documentation to fill the 17% gap:
1. File: /mnt/c/PythonProjects/QALoader/Docs/DEPLOYMENT.md
2. Include: Production setup, Docker, environment config, CI/CD, infrastructure
3. Follow DocumentationStandards.md for formatting
4. Ensure LLM can deploy from scratch using your guide
