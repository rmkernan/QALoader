```

### Method 2: Template-Based Export

#### Generate Template
```bash
./export_conversation.sh "Session Description"
```

#### Manual Addition
1. Open generated markdown file
2. Copy-paste conversation highlights into "Session Summary" section
3. Save and upload to Google Docs/Word

**Purpose:** Creates structured template with automatic context capture

**Usage:**
```bash
./export_conversation.sh "Session Title"
```

**Auto-generated content:**
- Current timestamp and project info
- Git branch and status
- Recent command history
- Modified files list
- Structured sections for manual content addition

**Output:** `conversation_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md`

#### 3. process_recording.sh
**Purpose:** Converts raw recordings to documentation format

**Usage:**
```bash
./process_recording.sh "recording_file.txt"
```

**Processing features:**
- Markdown formatting for readability
- Command summary extraction
- File operation highlighting
- Ready-to-share documentation format

**Output:** `recording_file_processed.md`

## Integration with Project Workflow

### When to Use Session Capture

#### Always Record:
- **Major feature implementations** (frontend-backend integration)
- **Problem-solving sessions** (debugging, optimization)
- **Architecture decisions** (design changes, refactoring)
- **Multi-Claude coordination** (when multiple developers involved)
- **Quality assurance sessions** (testing, validation)

#### Template Export for:
- **Quick updates** and status reports
- **Stakeholder communications** 
- **Documentation updates**
- **Issue resolution summaries**

### Recommended Naming Conventions

#### Session Names:
- `frontend_backend_integration`
- `phase5_analytics_development` 
- `debugging_auth_issues`
- `quality_testing_session`
- `architecture_planning`

#### File Organization:
```
Docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ SESSIONCAPTURE.md          # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ sessions/                  # Session recordings
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ recordings/           # Raw .txt files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ processed/            # Processed .md files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ exports/             # Google Docs exports
â””â”€â”€ templates/               # Conversation templates
```

## Best Practices

### During Recording
1. **Start with clear objective** - state session goals at beginning
2. **Provide context** - mention current branch, project phase
3. **Summarize accomplishments** - recap achievements at session end
4. **Note next steps** - document planned follow-up actions

### Post-Session Processing
1. **Process immediately** - convert while session is fresh in memory
2. **Add context notes** - include business context not captured in technical output
3. **Tag key decisions** - highlight important architectural or strategic choices
4. **Share appropriately** - distribute to relevant stakeholders

### Documentation Standards
1. **Consistent formatting** - use provided templates and scripts
2. **Clear timestamps** - include session date/time in Eastern Time
3. **Project context** - always include current phase and branch information
4. **Action items** - clearly document next steps and responsibilities

---

## Integration with Git Workflow

### Pre-Session Setup
```bash
# Verify clean state before important sessions
git status
git branch

# Create backup if needed
git branch backup/pre-session-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
```

### Post-Session Documentation
```bash
# Add session documentation to git
git add Docs/sessions/
git commit -m "docs: Add session capture for [session_topic]

Session captured key decisions and implementation details for [specific area].

Timestamp: $(date '+%B %d, %Y. %I:%M %p Eastern Time')

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Recording Not Starting
- **Check permissions:** `chmod +x *.sh`
- **Verify script location:** Run from project root directory
- **Check disk space:** Ensure sufficient storage for recordings

#### Large Recording Files
- **Compress old recordings:** `gzip old_session.txt`
- **Archive processed files:** Move to separate archive directory
- **Limit session length:** Break long sessions into focused segments

#### Processing Errors
- **Check file exists:** Verify recording file path
- **Check file permissions:** Ensure readable by processing script
- **Manual processing:** Fall back to manual template method

### Performance Optimization
- **Recording file size:** Monitor and rotate large files
- **Processing speed:** Use grep/sed for quick extractions
- **Storage management:** Archive old sessions regularly

---

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Processing
```bash
# Extract only error messages
grep -i "error\|fail\|exception" session.txt > errors_summary.txt

# Extract only successful operations
grep -i "success\|complete\|âœ…" session.txt > successes.txt

# Timeline extraction
grep "^\[" session.txt > timeline.txt
```

### Integration with External Tools
```bash
# Convert to PDF for formal documentation
pandoc session_processed.md -o session_report.pdf

# Upload to cloud storage
# (Add your preferred cloud sync commands)

# Email summary
mail -s "Session Summary: $(date)" team@company.com < session_summary.txt
```

## Security and Privacy

### Sensitive Information Handling
- **Review recordings** before sharing - remove any sensitive data
- **Check for credentials** in command outputs
- **Sanitize file paths** that might reveal sensitive directory structures
- **Consider anonymization** for external sharing

### File Management
- **Secure storage** for recordings containing sensitive project details
- **Access controls** for processed documentation
- **Retention policies** for old session recordings

---

## Support and Maintenance

### Script Updates
Session capture scripts are maintained in the project root directory. Updates should:
- **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing recordings
- **Follow project documentation standards**
- **Include version numbers** for tracking changes

### Feedback and Improvements
Session capture system improvements should be:
- **Documented in git commits** with clear change descriptions
- **Tested with sample sessions** before deployment
- **Communicated to all project developers**

*This documentation is part of the Q&A Loader project development standards and should be updated as the session capture system evolves.*
