# Bulk Delete and Selection Fix Handoff
**Date:** June 14, 2025. 9:45 a.m. Eastern Time
**Branch:** feature/bulk-delete-and-selection-fixes
**Session Focus:** Implementing bulk delete functionality and fixing checkbox selection bug

## Critical Issue Identified and Fixed

### Root Cause of Selection Bug
**Problem:** All checkboxes were selecting/unselecting together because `q.id` was `undefined`
**Reason:** Backend/Frontend data mismatch:
- Backend returns: `question_id`, `question`, `answer`
- Frontend expects: `id`, `questionText`, `answerText`

**Solution Applied:** Added transformation layer in `AppContext.tsx` (lines 108-115):
```typescript
const transformedQuestions = (data.questions || []).map((q: any) => ({
  ...q,
  id: q.question_id || q.id,
  questionText: q.question || q.questionText,
  answerText: q.answer || q.answerText
}));
```

## Work Completed

### 1. Backend Implementation
- Created `/backend/app/models/question_bulk.py` with:
  - `BulkDeleteRequest` model
  - `BulkDeleteResponse` model
- Added `bulk_delete_questions` to `QuestionService` (lines 440-527)
- Added `DELETE /api/questions/bulk` endpoint (lines 412-505 in questions.py)

### 2. Frontend Implementation
- Fixed selection bug by adding transformation layer
- Added `bulkDeleteQuestions` to:
  - `api.ts` (lines 291-319)
  - `AppContext.tsx` (lines 249-286)
  - `types.ts` (line 88)
- Updated `CurationView.tsx`:
  - Fixed selection dependency (line 116)
  - Added bulk delete confirmation modal (lines 504-579)
  - Added safety checks for >10 items deletion

### 3. Safety Features Implemented
- Confirmation modal shows preview of items to delete
- Requires typing "DELETE" for >10 items
- Handles partial success/failure
- Activity logging for audit trail

## Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. Authentication Errors (403 Forbidden)
- **Root Cause**: Session token key mismatch (`qa_loader_session` vs `qnaLoaderSessionToken`)
- **Solution**: Updated api.ts to import and use correct `SESSION_TOKEN_KEY` from constants
- **Status**: Fixed - all authenticated operations now work

### 2. Validation Errors (422 Unprocessable Entity) 
- **Root Cause**: Backend expects `question`/`answer` but frontend sends `questionText`/`answerText`
- **Solution**: Added data transformation layers in `updateQuestion` and `addNewQuestion`
- **Status**: Fixed - edit and create operations work correctly

### 3. Change Detection for Edit/Duplicate
- **Requirement**: Prevent saving when no changes made
- **Solution**: Added `hasChanges()` function with original value comparison
- **Status**: Implemented - prevents unnecessary saves and duplicate questions

### 4. All CRUD Operations
- **Create**: ✅ Working with field transformation
- **Read**: ✅ Working with display transformation  
- **Update**: ✅ Working with bidirectional transformation
- **Delete**: ✅ Individual and bulk delete working
- **Bulk Operations**: ✅ Full implementation with safety features

## Testing Completed ✅
- ✅ Individual checkbox selection working correctly
- ✅ Select all functionality working correctly  
- ✅ Individual delete operations working with authentication
- ✅ Edit operations working with change detection
- ✅ Duplicate operations preventing identical questions
- ✅ Bulk delete with confirmation modal and safety checks

## Final Status: COMPLETE ✅
All functionality implemented and tested. Ready for production use.

## Important Notes
- The backend uses `question_id` but frontend uses `id` - transformation is critical
- Similar issue with `question`/`questionText` and `answer`/`answerText`
- All new functions have JSDoc documentation
- Architecture Map updated with bulk operations workflow
