# Bulk Delete and Selection Fix Handoff
**Date:** June 14, 2025. 9:45 a.m. Eastern Time
**Branch:** feature/bulk-delete-and-selection-fixes
**Session Focus:** Implementing bulk delete functionality and fixing checkbox selection bug

## Critical Issue Identified and Fixed

### Root Cause of Selection Bug
**Problem:** All checkboxes were selecting/unselecting together because `q.id` was `undefined`
**Reason:** Backend/Frontend data mismatch:
- Backend returns: `question_id`, `question`, `answer`
- Frontend expects: `id`, `questionText`, `answerText`

**Solution Applied:** Added transformation layer in `AppContext.tsx` (lines 108-115):
```typescript
const transformedQuestions = (data.questions || []).map((q: any) => ({
  ...q,
  id: q.question_id || q.id,
  questionText: q.question || q.questionText,
  answerText: q.answer || q.answerText
}));
```

## Work Completed

### 1. Backend Implementation
- Created `/backend/app/models/question_bulk.py` with:
  - `BulkDeleteRequest` model
  - `BulkDeleteResponse` model
- Added `bulk_delete_questions` to `QuestionService` (lines 440-527)
- Added `DELETE /api/questions/bulk` endpoint (lines 412-505 in questions.py)

### 2. Frontend Implementation
- Fixed selection bug by adding transformation layer
- Added `bulkDeleteQuestions` to:
  - `api.ts` (lines 291-319)
  - `AppContext.tsx` (lines 249-286)
  - `types.ts` (line 88)
- Updated `CurationView.tsx`:
  - Fixed selection dependency (line 116)
  - Added bulk delete confirmation modal (lines 504-579)
  - Added safety checks for >10 items deletion

### 3. Safety Features Implemented
- Confirmation modal shows preview of items to delete
- Requires typing "DELETE" for >10 items
- Handles partial success/failure
- Activity logging for audit trail

## Remaining Issues

### 1. TypeScript Error
- Line 41 in CurationView.tsx: `Property 'bulkDeleteQuestions' does not exist on type 'AppContextType'`
- This is odd because it IS defined in types.ts line 88
- May need to restart TypeScript service

### 2. Key Prop Warning
- "Each child in a list should have a unique key prop" at line 403
- Already has `key={q.id}` - needs investigation

### 3. Testing Needed
- Individual checkbox selection
- Select all functionality
- Bulk delete with various counts
- Error handling for non-existent IDs

## Next Steps
1. Test the selection fix after restarting servers
2. Verify bulk delete works with the confirmation modal
3. Fix any remaining TypeScript errors
4. Test edge cases (empty questionText, missing questions)

## Important Notes
- The backend uses `question_id` but frontend uses `id` - transformation is critical
- Similar issue with `question`/`questionText` and `answer`/`answerText`
- All new functions have JSDoc documentation
- Architecture Map updated with bulk operations workflow
