    **Question:** Walk me through a basic LBO model.
    **Answer:** “In an LBO Model, Step 1 is making assumptions about the Purchase Price, Debt/Equity ratio, Interest Rate on Debt and other variables; you might also assume something about the company’s operations, such as Revenue Growth or Margins, depending on how much information you have.
    Step 2 is to create a Sources & Uses section, which shows how you finance the transaction and what you use the capital for; this also tells you how much Investor Equity is required.
    Step 3 is to adjust the company’s Balance Sheet for the new Debt and Equity figures, and also add in Goodwill & Other Intangibles on the Assets side to make everything balance.
    In Step 4, you project out the company’s Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement, and determine how much debt is paid off each year, based on the available Cash Flow and the required Interest Payments.
    Finally, in Step 5, you make assumptions about the exit after several years, usually assuming an EBITDA Exit Multiple, and calculate the return based on how much equity is returned to the firm.”

    **Question:** How do you pick purchase multiples and exit multiples in an LBO model?
    **Answer:** The same way you do it anywhere else: you look at what comparable companies are trading at, and what multiples similar LBO transactions have had. As always, you also show a range of purchase and exit multiples using sensitivity tables.
    Sometimes you set purchase and exit multiples based on a specific IRR target that you’re trying to achieve – but this is just for valuation purposes if you’re using an LBO model to value the company.

    **Question:** What is an “ideal” candidate for an LBO?
    **Answer:** “Ideal” candidates have stable and predictable cash flows, low-risk businesses, not much need for ongoing investments such as Capital Expenditures, as well as an opportunity for expense reductions to boost their margins. A strong management team also helps, as does a base of assets to use as collateral for debt.
    The most important part is stable cash flow.

    **Question:** How do you use an LBO model to value a company, and why do we sometimes say that it sets the “floor valuation” for the company?
    **Answer:** You use it to value a company by setting a targeted IRR (for example, 25%) and then back-solving in Excel to determine what purchase price the PE firm could pay to achieve that IRR.
    This is sometimes called a “floor valuation” because PE firms almost always pay less for a company than strategic acquirers would.

    **Question:** Give an example of a “real-life” LBO.
    **Answer:** The most common example is taking out a mortgage when you buy a house. Here’s how the analogy works:
    •   Down Payment:   Investor Equity in an LBO
    •   Mortgage:   Debt in an LBO
    •   Mortgage Interest Payments:   Debt Interest in an LBO
    •   Mortgage Repayments:   Debt Principal Repayments in an LBO
    •   Selling the House:   Selling the Company / Taking It Public in an LBO

    **Question:** What is the difference between bank debt and high-yield debt?
    **Answer:** This is a simplification, but broadly speaking there are 2 “types” of debt: “bank debt” and “high-yield debt.” There are many differences, but here are a few of the most important ones:
    •   High-yield debt tends to have higher interest rates than bank debt (hence the name “high-yield”).
    •   High-yield debt interest rates are usually fixed, whereas bank debt interest rates are “floating” – they change based on LIBOR or the Fed interest rate.
    •   High-yield debt has   incurrence covenants   while bank debt has   maintenance covenants . The main difference is that incurrence covenants   prevent   you from doing something (such as selling an asset, buying a factory, etc.) while maintenance covenants   require   you to maintain a minimum financial performance (for example, the Debt/EBITDA ratio must be below 5x at all times).
    •   Bank debt is usually   amortized   – the principal must be paid off over time – whereas with high-yield debt, the entire principal is due at the end ( bullet maturity ).
    Usually in a sizable Leveraged Buyout, the PE firm uses both types of debt.
    Again, there are many different types of debt – this is a simplification, but it’s enough for entry-level interviews.

#### Type: Question
    **Question:** Why might you use bank debt rather than high-yield debt in an LBO?
    **Answer:** If the PE firm or the company is concerned about meeting interest payments and wants a lower-cost option, they might use bank debt; they might also use bank debt if they are planning on major expansion or Capital Expenditures and don’t want to be restricted by incurrence covenants.

    **Question:** Why would a PE firm prefer high-yield debt instead?
    **Answer:** If the PE firm intends to refinance the company at some point or they don’t believe their returns are too sensitive to interest payments, they might use high-yield debt. They might also use the high-yield option if they don’t have plans for major expansion or selling off the company’s assets.
