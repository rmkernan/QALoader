## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Not Started)
**Objective:** Create backend project structure and basic FastAPI app

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create backend directory structure
- [ ] Set up Python virtual environment
- [ ] Install dependencies (FastAPI, Supabase, etc.)
- [ ] Create basic FastAPI application
- [ ] Configure CORS for frontend integration
- [ ] Verify server starts successfully

**Expected Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Next Steps:** Create `/backend` directory and follow TechnicalImplementationGuide.md

### Phase 2: Database Setup (Waiting for Phase 1)
**Objective:** Connect to Supabase and create database schema

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Configure Supabase connection
- [ ] Create database tables (all_questions, activity_log)
- [ ] Add database indexes
- [ ] Create data models and schemas
- [ ] Test database connectivity

**Expected Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 complete  

### Phase 3: Authentication System (Waiting for Phase 2)
**Objective:** Implement JWT-based authentication

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create JWT service functions
- [ ] Build login endpoint
- [ ] Add authentication middleware
- [ ] Test login flow

**Expected Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Dependencies:** Phase 2 complete  

### Phase 4: Question CRUD Operations (Waiting for Phase 3)
**Objective:** Build core question management endpoints

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create question service layer
- [ ] Build question ID generator
- [ ] Implement CREATE question endpoint
- [ ] Implement READ question endpoints (single + search)
- [ ] Implement UPDATE question endpoint
- [ ] Implement DELETE question endpoint
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations

**Expected Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Dependencies:** Phase 3 complete  

### Phase 5: Bootstrap & Activity System (Waiting for Phase 4)
**Objective:** Build dashboard data and activity logging

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create bootstrap data endpoint
- [ ] Build activity logging service
- [ ] Calculate topic summaries
- [ ] Test dashboard data loading

**Expected Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Dependencies:** Phase 4 complete  

### Phase 6: File Upload & Markdown Parser (Waiting for Phase 5)
**Objective:** Build file upload and markdown processing

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create markdown parser with hierarchy tracking
- [ ] Build file upload endpoint
- [ ] Implement batch replace operations
- [ ] Add transaction handling
- [ ] Test file processing end-to-end

**Expected Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Dependencies:** Phase 5 complete  

### Phase 7: Integration & Testing (Waiting for Phase 6)
**Objective:** Complete integration and testing

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update frontend to use backend APIs

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture
- **Backend Framework:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** JWT with password-based login
- **File Processing:** Custom markdown parser

### Database Schema
- **Main Table:** `all_questions` with human-readable IDs
- **Activity Table:** `activity_log` for dashboard feed
- **Indexes:** Optimized for filtering operations

### API Design
- **7 Core Endpoints:** Bootstrap, CRUD operations, file upload, batch operations
- **RESTful Design:** Following standard REST conventions
- **CORS Enabled:** For frontend integration

---

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites Met
- [x] WSL Ubuntu environment
- [x] Node.js and npm installed
- [x] Git repository configured
- [x] VS Code with extensions

### Prerequisites Needed
- [ ] Python 3.10+ in backend environment
- [ ] Supabase account and project
- [ ] Environment variables configured

## Next Session Instructions

**Immediate Actions for Next AI Assistant:**
1. Read this ProjectStatus.md for current state
2. Review TechnicalImplementationGuide.md for implementation steps
3. Begin Phase 1: Foundation Setup
4. Create backend directory structure
5. Set up Python environment and dependencies
6. Update this status file as progress is made

**Current Working Directory:** `/mnt/c/PythonProjects/QALoader`  
**Git Status:** All frontend code committed and pushed  
**Frontend Status:** Working at http://localhost:3000

## Known Issues & Considerations

### Potential Challenges
- Markdown parser complexity (hierarchical state tracking)
- Question ID generation (ensuring uniqueness)
- File upload transaction handling
- Frontend/backend integration testing

### Risk Mitigation
- Test each phase thoroughly before proceeding
- Maintain frontend functionality throughout development
- Regular git commits for rollback capability
- Follow established API contracts precisely
