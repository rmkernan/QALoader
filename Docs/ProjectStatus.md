## Known Issues & Considerations

### Potential Challenges
- Markdown parser complexity (hierarchical state tracking)
- Question ID generation (ensuring uniqueness)
- File upload transaction handling
- Frontend/backend integration testing

### Risk Mitigation
- Test each phase thoroughly before proceeding
- Maintain frontend functionality throughout development
- Regular git commits for rollback capability
- Follow established API contracts precisely
