# Handoff Protocol for Q&A Loader Backend Development

**Purpose:** Ensure seamless continuation of backend development across multiple AI conversations, compactions, and sessions.

**Created:** June 9, 2025  
**Project Phase:** Backend Development Ready

---

## Conversation Starter Prompt

**Copy and paste this prompt when starting a new conversation:**

```
You are continuing development of the Q&A Loader backend. This is a Python FastAPI + Supabase project.

CONTEXT:
- Frontend: Complete React TypeScript app with Dashboard, Loader, and Curation views
- Backend: Needs to be built to replace mock API calls in frontend
- Git repo: https://github.com/rmkernan/QALoader
- Working directory: /mnt/c/PythonProjects/QALoader

IMMEDIATELY UPON STARTING:
1. Read @Docs/HandoffProtocol.md for current status
2. Read @Docs/TechnicalImplementationGuide.md for detailed implementation steps
3. Read @Docs/BackendDesign.md and @Docs/APIs.md for specifications
4. Check @Docs/ProjectStatus.md for what's been completed
5. Follow the CLAUDE.md guidelines for development practices

PRIORITY: 
- Use simultaneous tool calls for efficiency
- Follow the phased implementation plan
- Test each phase before proceeding
- Create git commits with timestamps after significant progress
- Update ProjectStatus.md as work is completed

The user expects you to be immediately productive and continue where the previous session left off.
```

## Project Status Tracking

- **Current Phase:** Not Started - Need to begin Phase 1 (Foundation)
- **Next Action:** Set up backend project structure and database
- **Git Status:** Frontend committed and pushed to GitHub
- **Environment:** WSL Ubuntu, VS Code, Node.js frontend working

## Development Approach

### Multi-Session Strategy
1. **Phase-Based Development:** Complete entire phases before moving to next
2. **Status Documentation:** Update ProjectStatus.md after each significant milestone
3. **Git Commits:** Commit after each completed feature/fix
4. **Testing Strategy:** Test endpoints as they're built
5. **Documentation Updates:** Keep implementation guide current

### Handoff Requirements
Each session should:
1. **Start:** Read status and continue from last checkpoint
2. **Work:** Focus on current phase objectives
3. **Document:** Update progress in ProjectStatus.md
4. **Commit:** Save progress to Git with descriptive messages
5. **Handoff:** Clearly document next steps for continuation

### Quality Assurance
- Follow TypeScript best practices for any type definitions
- Maintain API contract compliance (see APIs.md)
- Test each endpoint as it's implemented
- Ensure frontend integration works
- Document any deviations or issues

## Key Reference Files

- **TechnicalImplementationGuide.md** - Step-by-step implementation instructions
- **BackendDesign.md** - Architecture and database schema
- **APIs.md** - Complete API endpoint specifications
- **ProjectStatus.md** - Current progress and next steps
- **CLAUDE.md** - Development standards and best practices

## Emergency Recovery

If implementation gets stuck or needs reset:
1. Check ProjectStatus.md for last known good state
2. Review git commit history for rollback points
3. Verify frontend still works before continuing backend
4. Follow TechnicalImplementationGuide.md from appropriate phase

---

## Success Criteria

Backend development is complete when:
- [ ] All 7 API endpoints implemented and tested
- [ ] Frontend works identically to current mock version
- [ ] Database operations are transactional and secure
- [ ] Authentication protects all endpoints
- [ ] Markdown parser handles hierarchical files correctly
- [ ] Full integration testing passes
- [ ] Documentation is updated and accurate

*This handoff protocol ensures continuous development progress regardless of conversation breaks or context limitations.*
