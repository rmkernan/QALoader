# Backend Implementation Plan - Non-Technical Overview

**Created:** June 9, 2025  
**Purpose:** High-level implementation strategy for the Q&A Loader backend to ensure complete frontend functionality coverage and proper development sequencing.

---

## What We're Building
A Python backend that replaces all the "fake" API calls in the frontend with real database operations. Think of it as the "brain" that stores and manages all the Q&A content.

## Implementation Order & Dependencies

### Phase 1: Foundation (Must Come First)
**Database Setup**
- Create the questions table in Supabase
- Set up database connection and basic operations

**Basic API Framework**
- Set up FastAPI server structure
- Create basic error handling and response formats
- Add authentication middleware

**Why First**: Everything else depends on having a working database and API foundation.

---

### Phase 2: Core Data Operations
**Question Management (CRUD)**
- Add new questions (`POST /questions`)
- Update existing questions (`PUT /questions/{id}`)
- Delete questions (`DELETE /questions/{id}`)
- Search/filter questions (`GET /questions`)

**ID Generation System**
- Create the `DCF-WACC-P-001` format ID generator
- Handle sequence numbering per topic/subtopic/type

**Why Second**: The Manage Content page needs these basic operations to work.

---

### Phase 3: Data Loading & Bootstrap
**Bootstrap Endpoint**
- Load all questions, topics, and activity log (`GET /bootstrap-data`)
- Calculate topic summaries and statistics

**Activity Logging System**
- Track user actions for the dashboard activity feed
- Store timestamps and action descriptions

**Why Third**: Dashboard and initial app loading depend on this data.

---

### Phase 4: File Processing
**Markdown Parser Engine**
- Parse hierarchical markdown files (topic → subtopic → difficulty → Q&A pairs)
- Handle state tracking as it moves through the file structure
- Validate parsed content

**Upload Endpoints**
- File upload handling (`POST /upload-markdown`)
- Batch replace operations (`POST /topics/{topic}/questions/batch-replace`)

**Why Fourth**: Most complex feature, depends on all previous phases working.

---

### Phase 5: Authentication & Security
**Login System**
- Password validation against environment variable
- JWT token generation and validation
- Protect all endpoints with authentication

**Why Last**: Can develop/test other features without auth, then add security layer.

## Frontend Coverage Verification

### Dashboard Functions ✅
- **Metrics Display**: Bootstrap endpoint provides question counts, topic summaries
- **Activity Feed**: Activity logging system tracks all user actions
- **Topic Navigation**: Bootstrap provides topic list, filtering works via question search

### Manage Content Functions ✅
- **Search & Filter**: Question search endpoint with all filter parameters
- **Add/Edit/Delete**: Full CRUD operations for individual questions
- **Bulk Operations**: Delete multiple questions (multiple API calls)
- **Export**: Backend provides data, frontend formats to markdown

### Load from Markdown Functions ✅
- **File Upload**: Upload endpoint processes files
- **Dry Run Preview**: Markdown parser analyzes content structure
- **Database Loading**: Batch replace endpoint updates questions by topic

### Authentication ✅
- **Login**: Password validation and token generation
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens protect all operations

## Risk Assessment
**Highest Risk**: Markdown parser complexity (hierarchical state tracking)  
**Medium Risk**: ID generation logic (ensuring uniqueness)  
**Lowest Risk**: Basic CRUD operations (standard database operations)

## Success Criteria
- Frontend works identically to current mock version
- All 7 API endpoints function correctly
- Database transactions ensure data integrity
- File uploads process without data loss
- Authentication secures all operations

## Next Steps
Once this plan is approved:
1. Create detailed technical implementation guide for AI assistants
2. Set up development environment and project structure
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Test each phase before proceeding to the next

*This plan ensures all frontend functionality is supported while maintaining logical development dependencies.*
