# Post-Conversation Clear Prompt

## Context Summary
I've been working on a Q&A question management system built with React frontend and FastAPI backend. We've completed Phase 1 of a 3-phase plan to remove topic selection and implement duplicate detection.

## What's Been Completed (Phase 1)
âœ… Removed topic selection from upload workflow - topics now extracted from markdown files
âœ… Fixed critical markdown validation bug - each question is self-contained with full headers  
âœ… Implemented question ID abbreviation system (e.g., ACC-UND-B-Q-001)
âœ… Made topic/subtopic required fields (no more "Unknown" defaults)
âœ… Updated both frontend and backend validation services
âœ… All changes committed and pushed to feature/phase5-analytics branch

## Current Issue Fixed
The markdown format has each question as a COMPLETE SELF-CONTAINED unit:
```markdown
# Topic: Accounting
## Subtopic: undefined  
### Difficulty: Basic
#### Type: Problem
    **Question:** What's the difference between LIFO and FIFO?
    **Answer:** [answer content]
```
DO NOT assume topics/subtopics are shared - each question has its own complete hierarchy.

## What's Next (Phases 2 & 3)
ðŸ“‹ **Read `PHASE_2_3_PLAN.md`** for complete implementation details

**Phase 2 (NEXT):** Pre-upload duplicate detection
- Add duplicate checking before upload
- Warn users about exact matches
- Modify upload workflow in LoaderView.tsx

**Phase 3:** Post-upload duplicate management 
- Find existing duplicates in database
- Provide resolution tools (merge/delete)
- Fuzzy matching for similar questions

## Key Files Modified in Phase 1
- `src/services/validation.ts` - Fixed question block extraction
- `backend/app/services/validation_service.py` - Made topic required
- `backend/app/utils/id_generator.py` - New abbreviation system
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added critical format documentation

## Database Updates Needed
Run the SQL queries in `database_updates.sql` to update existing question IDs with new abbreviation system.

## Start Phase 2 With
1. Read `PHASE_2_3_PLAN.md` thoroughly
2. Create `backend/app/services/duplicate_service.py` 
3. Add duplicate check endpoint to `backend/app/routers/upload.py`
4. Update `src/components/LoaderView.tsx` with duplicate checking step

**Project is ready for Phase 2 implementation!**
