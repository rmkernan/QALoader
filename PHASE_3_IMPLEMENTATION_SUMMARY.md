# Phase 3 Staging Workflow - Implementation Summary

**Created:** June 20, 2025. 11:07 AM Eastern Time

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Added Staging Types (`src/types.ts`)
- `UploadBatch` - Represents upload batches with review status
- `StagedQuestion` - Individual questions in staging
- `StagingDuplicate` - Duplicate detection records
- `BatchReviewRequest` & `DuplicateResolutionRequest` - API request types
- Added `STAGING` to View enum
- Updated `BatchUploadResult` to include `batchId` field

### 2. ✅ Added Staging API Endpoints (`src/services/api.ts`)
- `getStagingBatches()` - List batches with filters
- `getStagingBatch()` - Get batch details with questions
- `reviewStagedQuestions()` - Approve/reject questions
- `importBatchToProduction()` - Import approved questions
- `getStagingDuplicates()` - Get duplicate records
- `resolveStagingDuplicate()` - Resolve duplicates
- Updated `uploadMarkdownFile()` to support `useStaging` parameter (defaults to true)

### 3. ✅ Created StagingReviewView Component (`src/components/StagingReviewView.tsx`)
- Batch list view with status filters and pagination
- Batch detail view showing questions by status
- Bulk approve/reject functionality
- Duplicate resolution interface
- Progress tracking and statistics
- Complete with proper documentation and error handling

### 4. ✅ Updated Navigation
- Added "Staging Review" to constants (`src/constants.ts`)
- Added `StagingIcon` to icon components (`src/components/icons/IconComponents.tsx`)
- Updated Sidebar to include staging icon mapping (`src/components/Sidebar.tsx`)
- Added staging view routing in App.tsx

### 5. ✅ Updated Upload Flow
- Modified AppContext to pass `useStaging` parameter
- Updated `handleBatchUploadResult` to handle staging uploads
- Shows batch ID and navigation hint when uploaded to staging
- No bypass option - staging is always used by default

## Current Status

- All code compiles without TypeScript errors
- Frontend implementation complete per Phase 3 requirements
- Ready for testing with backend staging endpoints
- No additional features added beyond requirements

## Testing Required

1. Upload a markdown file and verify it goes to staging
2. Navigate to Staging Review and see the batch
3. Review individual questions (approve/reject)
4. Resolve any duplicates
5. Import approved questions to production

## Notes for Next Session

- Phase 1 & 2 (backend) are already complete and committed
- Frontend uses staging by default (no bypass option)
- The implementation follows existing patterns and conventions
- All files have updated timestamps and documentation
