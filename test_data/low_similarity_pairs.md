### Difficulty: Basic
#### Type: Question
    **Question:** If Depreciation is a non-cash expense, why does it affect the cash balance?
    **Answer:** Although Depreciation is a non-cash expense, it is tax-deductible. Since taxes are a cash expense, Depreciation affects cash by reducing the amount of taxes you pay.

#### Type: Question
    **Question:** Where does Depreciation usually show up on the Income Statement?
    **Answer:** It could be in a separate line item, or it could be embedded in Cost of Goods Sold or Operating Expenses – every company does it differently. Note that the end result for accounting questions is the same: Depreciation always reduces Pre-Tax Income.

# Topic: Accounting
## Subtopic: Equity Analysis
### Difficulty: Basic
#### Type: Question
    **Question:** Could you ever end up with negative shareholders' equity? What does it mean?
    **Answer:** Yes. It is common to see this in 2 scenarios: 1. Leveraged Buyouts with dividend recapitalizations – it means that the owner of the company has taken out a large portion of its equity (usually in the form of cash), which can sometimes turn the number negative. 2. It can also happen if the company has been losing money consistently and therefore has a declining Retained Earnings balance, which is a portion of Shareholders' Equity. It doesn't "mean" anything in particular, but it can be a cause for concern and possibly demonstrate that the company is struggling (in the second scenario).

### Difficulty: Basic
#### Type: Question
    **Question:** What are the warning signs of a company in financial distress?
    **Answer:** Key warning signs include declining cash flows, increasing debt levels, negative working capital, consistent losses leading to declining retained earnings, inability to meet debt obligations, and significant write-downs of assets. These factors can indicate a company's deteriorating financial position and potential bankruptcy risk.

# Topic: Accounting
## Subtopic: Inventory Management
### Difficulty: Basic
#### Type: Question
    **Question:** Why is the Income Statement not affected by changes in Inventory?
    **Answer:** This is a common interview mistake – incorrectly stating that Working Capital changes show up on the Income Statement. In the case of Inventory, the expense is only recorded when the goods associated with it are sold – so if it's just sitting in a warehouse, it does not count as a Cost of Good Sold or Operating Expense until the company manufactures it into a product and sells it.

# Topic: Accounting
## Subtopic: Revenue Recognition
### Difficulty: Basic
#### Type: Question
    **Question:** When does inventory become an expense on the Income Statement?
    **Answer:** Inventory becomes an expense (Cost of Goods Sold) on the Income Statement only when the inventory is actually sold to customers. Until that point, inventory remains as an asset on the Balance Sheet. This follows the matching principle in accounting, where expenses are recognized in the same period as the related revenues.
