    **Question:** Walk me through the 3 financial statements.
    **Answer:** The 3 major financial statements are the Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement. The Income Statement gives the company's revenue and expenses, and goes down to Net Income, the final line on the statement. The Balance Sheet shows the company's Assets – its resources – such as Cash, Inventory and PP&E, as well as its Liabilities – such as Debt and Accounts Payable – and Shareholders' Equity. Assets must equal Liabilities plus Shareholders' Equity. The Cash Flow Statement begins with Net Income, adjusts for non-cash expenses and working capital changes, and then lists cash flow from investing and financing activities; at the end, you see the company's net change in cash.

    **Question:** Walk me through how Depreciation going up by $10 would affect the statements.
    **Answer:** Income Statement: Operating Income would decline by $10 and assuming a 40% tax rate, Net Income would go down by $6. Cash Flow Statement: The Net Income at the top goes down by $6, but the $10 Depreciation is a non-cash expense that gets added back, so overall Cash Flow from Operations goes up by $4. There are no changes elsewhere, so the overall Net Change in Cash goes up by $4. Balance Sheet: Plants, Property & Equipment goes down by $10 on the Assets side because of the Depreciation, and Cash is up by $4 from the changes on the Cash Flow Statement. Overall, Assets is down by $6. Since Net Income fell by $6 as well, Shareholders' Equity on the Liabilities & Shareholders' Equity side is down by $6 and both sides of the Balance Sheet balance.

    **Question:** Show me how increasing Depreciation by $10 would impact the financial statements.
    **Answer:** Income Statement: Operating Income decreases by $10 and with a 40% tax rate, Net Income decreases by $6. Cash Flow Statement: Net Income at the top decreases by $6, but the $10 Depreciation is added back as a non-cash expense, so Cash Flow from Operations increases by $4. The Net Change in Cash increases by $4. Balance Sheet: PP&E decreases by $10 on the Assets side due to Depreciation, and Cash increases by $4 from the Cash Flow Statement changes. Assets decrease by $6 overall. Since Net Income decreased by $6, Shareholders' Equity decreases by $6 and the Balance Sheet balances.

    **Question:** What happens when Inventory goes up by $10, assuming you pay for it with cash?
    **Answer:** No changes to the Income Statement. On the Cash Flow Statement, Inventory is an asset so that decreases your Cash Flow from Operations – it goes down by $10, as does the Net Change in Cash at the bottom. On the Balance Sheet under Assets, Inventory is up by $10 but Cash is down by $10, so the changes cancel out and Assets still equals Liabilities & Shareholders' Equity.

    **Question:** What happens when Inventory increases by $10, paid with cash?
    **Answer:** Income Statement is not affected. Cash Flow Statement: Inventory increase reduces Cash Flow from Operations by $10, and Net Change in Cash decreases by $10. Balance Sheet: Under Assets, Inventory increases by $10 while Cash decreases by $10, so the changes offset each other and Assets still equals Liabilities & Shareholders' Equity.
