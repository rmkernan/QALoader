#### Type: Question
    **Question:** Walk me through the 3 financial statements.
    **Answer:** The 3 major financial statements are the Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement. The Income Statement gives the company's revenue and expenses, and goes down to Net Income, the final line on the statement. The Balance Sheet shows the company's Assets – its resources – such as Cash, Inventory and PP&E, as well as its Liabilities – such as Debt and Accounts Payable – and Shareholders' Equity. The Cash Flow Statement begins with Net Income, adjusts for non-cash expenses and working capital changes, and then lists cash flow from investing and financing activities.

    **Question:** How do the 3 statements link together?
    **Answer:** To tie the statements together, Net Income from the Income Statement flows into Shareholders' Equity on the Balance Sheet, and into the top line of the Cash Flow Statement. Changes to Balance Sheet items appear as working capital changes on the Cash Flow Statement, and investing and financing activities affect Balance Sheet items such as PP&E, Debt and Shareholders' Equity. The Cash and Shareholders' Equity items on the Balance Sheet act as "plugs," with Cash flowing in from the final line on the Cash Flow Statement.

    **Question:** If I were stranded on a desert island, only had 1 statement and I wanted to review the overall health of a company – which statement would I use and why?
    **Answer:** You would use the Cash Flow Statement because it gives a true picture of how much cash the company is actually generating, independent of all the non-cash expenses you might have. And that's the #1 thing you care about when analyzing the overall financial health of any business – its cash flow.

## Subtopic: Working Capital
### Difficulty: Basic
#### Type: Question
    **Question:** What is Working Capital? How is it used?
    **Answer:** Working Capital = Current Assets – Current Liabilities. If it's positive, it means a company can pay off its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. It is often presented as a financial metric and its magnitude and sign (negative or positive) tells you whether or not the company is "sound."

### Difficulty: Basic
#### Type: Question
    **Question:** How do you calculate Working Capital and what does it indicate?
    **Answer:** Working Capital is calculated as Current Assets minus Current Liabilities. When positive, it indicates that a company has sufficient short-term assets to cover its short-term obligations. This metric is commonly used to assess a company's liquidity position and short-term financial health. The size and direction of working capital changes can signal whether a company is managing its operations effectively.
