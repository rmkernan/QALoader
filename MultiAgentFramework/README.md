# Multi-Agent Coordination Framework

**Transform complex projects through orchestrated AI collaboration**

Version 1.0 | Created from proven success on QALoader project | June 10th 2025

---

## What Is This?

A **reusable framework** that enables a single human operator to coordinate multiple AI agents to accomplish complex tasks that would overwhelm a single LLM. Through careful orchestration, parallel execution, and intelligent synthesis, this framework has achieved remarkable results:


## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Copy framework to your project
cp -r MultiAgentFramework/ /your/project/

# 2. Start Claude Code as Orchestrator
claude --model claude-opus-4

# 3. Paste the startup prompt from Docs/STARTUP_PROMPT.txt

# 4. Follow the orchestrator's guidance
```

That's it! The orchestrator will guide you through selecting and executing a mission.

## How It Works

### The Magic: Coordinated Intelligence

```
Human Operator
      |
      v
Orchestrator (Strategic Brain)
    /   \
   v     v
Agent1  Agent2 (Parallel Execution)
   \     /
    v   v
 Synthesis → Results
```

1. **Orchestrator** breaks complex tasks into parallel work
2. **Agents** execute complementary assignments simultaneously  
3. **Human** relays simple triggers between components
4. **Synthesis** combines findings into insights neither agent could achieve alone

### Communication Protocol

- **15-line message limit** prevents context bloat
- **User-mediated triggers** maintain control
- **File-based channels** enable asynchronous operation
- **Stateless design** supports interruption/resumption

## Available Missions

### 📚 Documentation Audit & Reorganization
*Transform scattered docs into LLM-friendly systems*

- **Problem:** Documentation scattered across dozens of files
- **Solution:** Create unified entry points and navigation
- **Result:** 95% task completion rate for new LLMs

## Key Innovations

### 🎯 Token Efficiency
- Agents handle token-intensive discovery
- Orchestrator maintains strategic context  
- 15-line limit prevents context explosion

### ⚡ Parallel Processing  
- Two agents work simultaneously
- Complementary task assignment
- No blocking or dependencies

### 🧠 Model Optimization
- Opus for strategic thinking
- Sonnet for routine execution
- Dynamic switching based on task needs

### 💾 Robust Continuity
- Memory system preserves knowledge
- Handoff protocols prevent work loss
- Resume anytime, anywhere

## Creating Custom Missions

The framework is designed for extension. Any complex task that can be:
- Split into parallel subtasks
- Phased from discovery to delivery
- Measured for success

Can become a mission. See `Docs/NEW_MISSION_GUIDE.md` for complete instructions.

## Best Practices

### For Optimal Results:
- ✅ **Trust the process** - Let agents work independently
- ✅ **Maintain async mindset** - No rush, quality over speed
- ✅ **Document discoveries** - Memory updates are crucial
- ✅ **Commit regularly** - Preserve work with git

### Avoid:
- ❌ **Micromanaging agents** - They know their assignments
- ❌ **Skipping protocols** - They exist for good reasons
- ❌ **Clearing context** - Compact instead when possible
- ❌ **Rushing phases** - Let synthesis happen naturally

## The Power of Coordination

This framework represents a breakthrough in LLM capability multiplication. By coordinating multiple specialized agents, we can tackle problems that would overwhelm any single AI:

- **Complex analysis** requiring multiple perspectives
- **Large-scale refactoring** needing parallel execution  
- **Strategic planning** combining analysis and synthesis
- **Quality assurance** through independent validation

## Getting Started

1. **Read** `Docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
2. **Deploy** the framework to your project
3. **Launch** Claude Code with the orchestrator prompt
4. **Select** your mission and follow the flow
5. **Marvel** at what coordinated AI can accomplish
