**Agent:** Agent 1
**Date:** June 16, 2025. 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time
**Updated:** June 16, 2025. 07:10 PM Eastern Time - Corrected timestamp to align with documentation standards.
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Task:** Build the complete frontend user interface for the QuizMe feature.

## 1. Summary of Work Completed

I have successfully implemented the three core pages required for the QuizMe user experience, creating a full-featured, end-to-end flow from quiz selection to results review. The implementation adheres to the established MockMe design patterns and is fully responsive.

The following files have been created:

1.  **Quiz Selection Page:** `/app/(authenticated)/mentor/quiz/page.tsx`
2.  **Quiz Taking Interface:** `/app/(authenticated)/mentor/quiz/[sessionId]/page.tsx`
3.  **Results Display Page:** `/app/(authenticated)/mentor/quiz/[sessionId]/results/page.tsx`

All pages integrate the UI components developed in the previous phase and are structured to consume the API endpoints being developed by Agent 2. Placeholder data and mock API calls have been used to ensure the UI is functional and testable in isolation.

## 2. Page-by-Page Breakdown

### A. Quiz Selection Page
-   **File:** `/app/(authenticated)/mentor/quiz/page.tsx`
-   **Functionality:**
    -   Fetches available quiz topics from `/api/quiz/topics`.
    -   Integrates the `DifficultyToggle` component for 'Basic'/'Advanced' selection.
    -   Features a 'Start Quiz' button that is only enabled when both a topic and difficulty are selected.
    -   Handles loading and error states gracefully.
    -   Upon starting, it calls `/api/quiz/start` and navigates the user to the quiz-taking interface with the new `sessionId`.

### B. Quiz Taking Interface
-   **File:** `/app/(authenticated)/mentor/quiz/[sessionId]/page.tsx`
-   **Functionality:**
    -   Uses the `QuizProgressIndicator` to show the user's position and allow navigation between questions.
    -   Displays questions sequentially using the `QuizQuestion` component.
    -   Captures user input via the `QuizAnswerInput` component.
    -   Implements an auto-save feature that writes progress to `localStorage` every 30 seconds to prevent data loss.
    -   Includes a confirmation dialog before final submission to `/api/quiz/submit`.

### C. Results Display Page
-   **File:** `/app/(authenticated)/mentor/quiz/[sessionId]/results/page.tsx`
-   **Functionality:**
    -   Fetches and displays final results from `/api/quiz/results/[sessionId]`.
    -   Presents a prominent score card with the overall score (e.g., 8/10) and a performance summary (e.g., 'Excellent!').
    -   Provides a detailed, question-by-question review in a collapsible accordion format, showing the user's answer and the correct answer.
    -   Offers clear navigation options to start a new quiz or return to the dashboard.

## 3. Component Integration

The following pre-built components from Phase 1 were successfully integrated:
-   `DifficultyToggle`
-   `QuizProgressIndicator`
-   `QuizQuestion`
-   `QuizAnswerInput`

This modular approach ensures a consistent look and feel and demonstrates the reusability of the component library.

## 4. Next Steps & Dependencies

The frontend is now functionally complete from a UI perspective. The next and final step for full feature completion is to replace the mock data and placeholder API logic with live calls to Agent 2's endpoints once they are available. The code is structured to make this a straightforward process.
