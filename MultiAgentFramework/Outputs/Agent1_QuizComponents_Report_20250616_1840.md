**Task:** Create QuizMe Basic UI Components for MockMe Platform

---

## Summary of Work

All four React components for the QuizMe basic UI have been successfully created and are ready for integration. The components were developed according to the specifications provided in `/mnt/c/pythonprojects/QALoader/MultiAgentFramework/Tasks/Task_20250616_1812_Agent1_BasicComponents.md`.

## Components Created

The following components were created in the directory `/mnt/c/PythonProjects/ClickablePrototype/mvp/src/components/quiz/`:

1.  **`DifficultyToggle.tsx`**: A toggle button group for selecting 'Basic' or 'Advanced' difficulty.
2.  **`QuizProgressIndicator.tsx`**: A visual indicator of quiz progress, showing current, answered, and unanswered questions, with clickable navigation.
3.  **`QuizQuestion.tsx`**: A component to display the text of a single quiz question.
4.  **`QuizAnswerInput.tsx`**: An auto-expanding textarea for users to input their answers.

All components are exported from `/mnt/c/PythonProjects/ClickablePrototype/mvp/src/components/quiz/index.ts`.

## Requirements Met

-   **TypeScript:** All components are written in TypeScript with proper interfaces for props.
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS utility classes were used for styling, adhering to general shadcn/ui patterns and the provided design specifications. The `cn` utility is used for conditional class application.
-   **Responsiveness:** Components were designed with mobile responsiveness in mind.
-   **Animations:** Smooth transitions and animations (e.g., fade-in for QuizQuestion, height transition for QuizAnswerInput, color transitions for DifficultyToggle) have been implemented as specified.
-   **Documentation:** Each component file includes a JSDoc file-level header with creation date, description, architectural context, and workflow context. Props interfaces and components themselves also have JSDoc comments.
-   **Accessibility:** Basic ARIA attributes and focus management have been included as per specifications.

## Next Steps

The components are now ready for review and integration into the MockMe QuizMe feature.
