# Mission Brief: Documentation Audit & Reorganization

**Mission Type:** Documentation Audit  
**Estimated Duration:** 4-6 hours across multiple sessions  
**Recommended Orchestrator Model:** Opus for synthesis, Sonnet for execution

---

## Mission Objectives

### Primary Goal
Transform scattered, redundant documentation into a unified, LLM-friendly system that enables 90%+ task completion rate for new AI assistants joining the project.

### Specific Objectives
1. **Discovery:** Catalog all documentation files and their purposes
2. **Analysis:** Identify redundancy, gaps, and navigation issues  
3. **Design:** Create optimal hierarchy with clear entry points
4. **Implementation:** Build PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md and DOCUMENTATION_CATALOG.md
5. **Validation:** Test with fresh perspective to ensure effectiveness

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- ✓ 90%+ LLM task completion rate (up from baseline)
- ✓ <5 minutes to answer "What is this project?"
- ✓ Clear navigation paths for common tasks
- ✓ Redundancy reduced without losing information

### Qualitative Outcomes
- ✓ New LLMs can self-orient using documentation
- ✓ Clear learning path: Overview → Architecture → Specifics
- ✓ Task-based navigation (not just file-based)
- ✓ Confidence in documentation completeness

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis (2 agents parallel)
**Agent1 Focus:** Documentation inventory and structure mapping
- Find all .md files across project
- Categorize by purpose and audience  
- Identify redundancy and overlap
- Map current navigation paths

**Agent2 Focus:** Quality and effectiveness assessment
- Evaluate documentation completeness
- Test task scenario success rates
- Identify critical gaps
- Assess code comment quality

**Orchestrator Synthesis:** Current state assessment

### Phase 2: Design & Architecture (2 agents parallel)
**Agent1 Focus:** Information architecture design
- Design optimal file hierarchy
- Plan consolidation strategy
- Create navigation structure
- Define entry points

**Agent2 Focus:** Content templates and standards
- Design PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md template
- Create DOCUMENTATION_CATALOG.md structure
- Plan task-based navigation paths
- Define documentation standards

**Orchestrator Synthesis:** Implementation plan

### Phase 3: Implementation (2 agents parallel)
**Agent1 Focus:** Create DOCUMENTATION_CATALOG.md
- Build comprehensive file catalog
- Add purpose descriptions
- Create task navigation paths
- Include relevance indicators

**Agent2 Focus:** Create PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
- Answer core questions (purpose, features, architecture)
- Provide project orientation
- Link to detailed documentation
- Include quick reference section

**Orchestrator Synthesis:** Integration and refinement

### Phase 4: Validation & Testing (2 agents parallel)
**Agent1 Focus:** Fresh LLM simulation
- Test project understanding from scratch
- Validate navigation paths
- Identify remaining gaps
- Measure task success rate

**Agent2 Focus:** Task scenario testing
- Test common developer tasks
- Validate documentation paths
- Check completeness
- Assess clarity

**Orchestrator Synthesis:** Success validation

## Known Challenges

### Common Issues:
1. **Hidden Documentation:** Docs in unexpected places
2. **README Variants:** Multiple competing overviews
3. **Stale Content:** Outdated information
4. **Missing Pieces:** Deployment, setup, architecture
5. **Poor Navigation:** No clear starting point

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Comprehensive file discovery (not just Docs/ folder)
- Content comparison for redundancy
- Timestamp checking for staleness
- Gap analysis against common needs
- User-journey based navigation

## Deliverables

### Core Deliverables:
1. `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Primary entry point
2. `DOCUMENTATION_CATALOG.md` - Navigation hub
3. `DocumentationAudit_Agent[N]_[date].md` - Analysis reports
4. `FinalSynthesis_Orchestrator_[date].md` - Summary and recommendations

### Optional Deliverables:
- Cleaned up redundant files
- Updated README.md
- Archive of outdated docs
- Documentation standards guide

## Resource Requirements

### Tools Needed:
- File discovery (Glob)
- Content search (Grep)
- File reading (Read)
- File writing (Write/Edit)
- Memory management (Neo4j)

### Typical File Counts:
- Small projects: 10-30 documentation files
- Medium projects: 30-100 documentation files
- Large projects: 100+ documentation files

## Mission-Specific Notes

### What Makes Documentation "Good":
- Answers user questions quickly
- Provides clear navigation
- Eliminates guesswork
- Enables self-service
- Maintains accuracy

### Red Flags to Watch For:
- Multiple files with same purpose
- No clear entry point
- Circular references
- Missing critical topics
- Assumption of prior knowledge

### Quick Wins:
- Create PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md even if nothing else
- Fix README.md to point to right places
- Delete obviously redundant files
- Create deployment documentation
- Add navigation aids
