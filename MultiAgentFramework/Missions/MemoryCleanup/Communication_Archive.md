## Agent2 Final Report

---[AGENT2-2025.06.13-15:50]---
Status: COMPLETED
Task: Neo4j Memory Cleanup for Multi-Agent Framework Discovery
Result: Complete audit and cleanup successfully executed

**Memory Cleanup Actions Taken:**

**OBSOLETE MEMORIES DELETED:**
- Agent Coordination Protocol entity (old AgentCoord system)
- Agent1 entity (legacy agent references from old system)  
- Agent2 entity (legacy agent references from old system)

**NEW FRAMEWORK DISCOVERY MEMORY CREATED:**
- MultiAgentFramework Discovery entity with current framework location
- References: /MultiAgentFramework/ directory structure
- Documentation paths: Core/AgentInstructions.md, Core/Agent1.md, Core/Agent2.md
- Framework purpose: Token-efficient multi-agent coordination

**VALIDATION TEST RESULTS:**
- Search "multi-agent framework" now returns clean MultiAgentFramework Discovery
- Legacy AgentCoord references successfully removed
- Future Claude instances will find MultiAgentFramework/ clearly
- Framework discovery path validated and operational

**SUCCESS CRITERIA MET:**
✅ All AgentCoord memories removed  
✅ New framework discovery memories created
✅ Clean search results for "multi-agent framework"
✅ Framework discoverability confirmed for future Claude instances

Deliverable: Memory cleanup complete - framework discovery optimized
Next: Ready for orchestrator validation and next assignment

## Mission Deliverables

1. **Neo4j Memory State:** Cleaned and optimized for framework discovery
2. **Framework Discovery:** Validated working memory references
3. **Protocol Validation:** Demonstrated successful multi-agent coordination
4. **Process Improvement:** Identified file cleanup needs (led to Option A protocol)
