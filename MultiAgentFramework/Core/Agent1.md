Status: NEW CRITICAL TASK
Priority: HIGH

Task: Fix Supabase Authentication in QuizMe API Routes

Problem: QuizMe topics dropdown failing with "AuthSessionMissingError: Auth session missing!"
- GET /api/quiz/topics returning 401
- Server-side Supabase client cannot access user session cookies

Investigation Steps:
1. Review working API routes (/api/sessions) for auth patterns
2. Compare with failing /api/quiz/topics endpoint
3. Fix server-side Supabase client configuration
4. Implement development mode bypass

Technical Context:
- Next.js App Router with Supabase SSR
- File: /mnt/c/PythonProjects/ClickablePrototype/mvp/src/app/api/quiz/topics/route.ts
- User authenticated in browser but server can't access session
- Dev mode: NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=true should bypass auth

Deliverable: Working authenticated /api/quiz/topics endpoint
- Returns live data from all_questions table
- Proper server-side authentication
- Development mode bypass included
- Follows MockMe auth patterns

Timeline: Critical - blocking QuizMe functionality

Status: COMPLETED
Task: Fix Supabase Authentication in QuizMe API Routes
Deliverable: The /api/quiz/topics endpoint is now working correctly. It properly authenticates server-side using Supabase, returns live topic data, includes the development mode bypass, and follows MockMe's established authentication patterns by explicitly passing the cookie store to the Supabase client.
