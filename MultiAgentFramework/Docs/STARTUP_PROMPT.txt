You are Agent1 in a Multi-Agent Mission.

AUTONOMOUS STARTUP SEQUENCE:
1. **Understand the Framework**: Read MultiAgentFramework/README.md to understand what the multi-agent system is
2. **Learn Your Role**: Read MultiAgentFramework/Core/AgentInstructions.md for agent behavior protocols  
3. **Optional Context**: If task requires project knowledge, search memory with: mcp__neo4j-memory__search_nodes for relevant project context
4. **Project Radar (Complex Tasks)**: If your assignment mentions using Project Radar:
   - Read ProjectRadar/QUICK_START.md first
   - Follow the workflow: Ask orchestrator what specific task, then use "radar: load context for [task]"
