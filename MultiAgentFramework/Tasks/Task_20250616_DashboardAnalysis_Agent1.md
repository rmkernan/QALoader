# Task: Dashboard Integration & User History Analysis

**Created:** 2025.06.16_ 6:37PM ET  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of MockMe's dashboard system and quiz integration requirements

## Background
Before finalizing the QuizMe database schema and implementing the quiz pages, we need to understand how quiz data will integrate with MockMe's existing dashboard and user profile systems. Your long context window makes you ideal for this comprehensive analysis.

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Analyze Existing Dashboard Architecture
**Location:** `/mnt/c/PythonProjects/ClickablePrototype/mvp/src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/`

Examine and document:
- Current dashboard components and their data sources
- Existing metrics and KPIs displayed
- How session data flows into dashboard widgets
- User profile/history viewing patterns
- Database queries used for dashboard data

### 2. Identify Session History Patterns
**Locations to analyze:**
- Dashboard session displays
- User profile pages
- Session detail views
- Any existing quiz/mentor session history

Document:
- How users currently view past sessions
- What data is shown in session summaries
- Filtering and sorting capabilities
- Performance metrics tracked per user

### 3. Define Quiz Dashboard Requirements
Based on your analysis, specify what quiz data should appear in:

**Dashboard Widgets:**
- Recent quiz performance metrics
- Progress tracking across topics
- Comparative performance (improvement trends)
- Quiz completion streaks

**User Profile/History:**
- Individual quiz session details
- Topic-specific performance history
- Difficulty progression tracking
- Historical score comparisons

### 4. Database Schema Recommendations
Based on dashboard requirements, identify:
- What fields are needed in quiz_results for efficient dashboard queries
- Required indexes for performance
- Aggregation tables needed for complex metrics
- Data retention considerations

## Specific Analysis Tasks

### A. Dashboard Components Review
Read and analyze all dashboard-related files:
```
/dashboard/page.tsx
/dashboard/components/
/components/dashboard/
```
Document each component's data requirements and rendering patterns.

### B. Session Integration Patterns
Examine how current AI Mentor sessions integrate with:
- Dashboard displays
- User navigation
- Performance tracking
- Historical views

### C. User Experience Flow
Map the complete user journey for:
- Viewing recent activity
- Accessing session history
- Filtering by session type
- Drilling down into session details

### D. Performance Considerations
Identify:
- Current query patterns for dashboard data
- Database performance bottlenecks
- Caching strategies used
- Real-time vs aggregated data usage

## Deliverables

### 1. Dashboard Integration Report
**File:** Create comprehensive report documenting:
- Current dashboard architecture overview
- Session data flow analysis
- Integration points for quiz data
- User experience patterns

### 2. Quiz Dashboard Requirements Specification
Define exactly what quiz metrics should appear:
- Dashboard widget specifications
- User profile additions needed
- Historical data presentation requirements
- Mobile responsive considerations

### 3. Database Schema Recommendations
Based on dashboard needs, specify:
- Required fields for quiz_results table
- Indexes needed for dashboard performance
- Aggregation tables for complex metrics
- Query optimization recommendations

### 4. Implementation Roadmap
Priority order for dashboard integration:
- Phase 1: Basic quiz results display
- Phase 2: Advanced metrics and analytics
- Phase 3: Comparative analysis and insights

## Technical Context

### Current MockMe Stack
- Next.js App Router
- Supabase for data
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- TypeScript throughout

### Quiz Feature Context
- 10-question structured quizzes
- Basic/Advanced difficulty levels
- AI-powered evaluation and feedback
- Integration with QALoader service

## Success Criteria
- Complete understanding of dashboard architecture
- Clear requirements for quiz data integration
- Actionable database schema recommendations
- Smooth user experience design for quiz history

Your comprehensive analysis will guide the final database design and ensure seamless integration with MockMe's existing user experience patterns.
