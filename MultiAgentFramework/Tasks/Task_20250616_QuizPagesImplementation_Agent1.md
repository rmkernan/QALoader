# Task: QuizMe Frontend Pages Implementation

**Created:** 2025.06.16_ 7:03PM ET  
**Purpose:** Build complete QuizMe user interface using existing components and API endpoints

## Background
With your UI components complete, Agent 2's API endpoints in progress, and database design finalized, you're ready to build the actual QuizMe pages. This will create the complete user experience from topic selection to results viewing.

## Page Implementation Requirements

### 1. Quiz Selection Page
**File:** `/mnt/c/PythonProjects/ClickablePrototype/mvp/src/app/(authenticated)/mentor/quiz/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Topic dropdown populated from `/api/quiz/topics`
- Your DifficultyToggle component (Basic/Advanced)
- Start Quiz button (disabled until both selected)
- Loading states and error handling
- Integration with existing MockMe auth patterns

### 2. Quiz Taking Interface  
**File:** `/mnt/c/PythonProjects/ClickablePrototype/mvp/src/app/(authenticated)/mentor/quiz/[sessionId]/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Your QuizProgressIndicator component (1-10 questions)
- Sequential question display using QuizQuestion component
- Your QuizAnswerInput for user responses
- Auto-save to localStorage every 30 seconds
- Review mode after question 10
- Submit confirmation dialog

### 3. Results Display Page
**File:** `/mnt/c/PythonProjects/ClickablePrototype/mvp/src/app/(authenticated)/mentor/quiz/[sessionId]/results/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Overall score display with animation
- Performance breakdown (Excellent/Good/Needs Work)
- Detailed per-question feedback (collapsible)
- Navigation to new quiz or dashboard

## Technical Integration Points

### Use Your Existing Components
- DifficultyToggle (from Phase 1)
- QuizProgressIndicator (from Phase 1)
- QuizQuestion (from Phase 1)
- QuizAnswerInput (from Phase 1)

### API Integration
Work with Agent 2's endpoints:
- GET /api/quiz/topics

### State Management
Implement quiz state following Agent 2's type definitions:

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Follow MockMe Patterns
- Use existing layout patterns from `/mentor/select/page.tsx`
- Follow authentication patterns
- Use established error handling
- Maintain responsive design

### 2. User Experience Flow
1. User selects topic + difficulty → Start Quiz
2. Answer 10 questions sequentially with auto-save
3. Review all answers → Submit for evaluation
4. View comprehensive results with feedback

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness
- Single column layout on mobile
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Responsive typography and spacing

## Success Criteria
- Complete quiz flow from selection to results
- All your Phase 1 components integrated
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Auto-save functionality working
- Error states handled gracefully
- Mobile responsive design

This completes the frontend implementation, creating a working QuizMe feature ready for user testing.
